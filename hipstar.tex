%This document describes the most common article elements and how to use the IEEEtran class with \LaTeX \ to produce files that are suitable for submission to the IEEE.  IEEEtran can produce conference, journal, and technical note (correspondence) papers with a suitable choice of class options. 

\pj{This first paragraph is optional, we can remove it:}
Due to NVIDIA dominating the GPU market and despite its lack of cross-vendor portability, the C/C++-based application programming interface of CUDA and its related key libraries are still used in a significant fraction of software utilizing GPU-based acceleration. AMD's ROCm and its Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability (HIP) aims to alleviate the CUDA's lack of portability by providing a route out from the NVIDIA CUDA platform to AMD's devices.
  
In this article we describe \textit{hipstar}, an open source software platform which allows running CUDA and HIP programs on an a open cross-vendor standard software platform consisting of an OpenCL/SPIR-V backend and a carefully crafted set of standard extensions. We discuss the relevant technical aspects of \textit{hipstar} related to the feature mismatches between CUDA/HIP and OpenCL and exemplify its runtime overheads in comparison to executing CUDA/HIP applications directly with NVIDIA's CUDA software platform. The measurements show that the overheads induced by \textit{hipstar} are typically only in the order of N-M\%, thus negligible.\pj{TODO} Although being a relatively young code base, \textit{hipstar} is now considered mature enough for production use, as demonstrated by multiple application porting case studies performed for the Aurora supercomputer.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{W}{alled} garden strategy is popular within market dominating companies. Its purpose is to lock-in customers to company's products by making escaping the gates of the garden as costly as possible. NVIDIA's CUDA software platform is considered to be one of such walled gardens. It in part helps NVIDIA to expand and keep a foothold of their GPU market advantage, and at the same time maintain high innovation pace on the software APIs since there is no need to work with standardization committees that always have to aim for a consensus among multiple participating vendors.

For the end-users and other hardware vendors, naturally, the situation of a single-vendor dominating API is not optimal. End-users benefit from open standard software interfaces that enable switching the hardware without incurring significant non-recurring engineering costs required for porting all the legacy applications and libraries to a new software platform just to be able to utilize the purchased hardware optimally. Similarly, other hardware vendors aiming to get their piece of the market pie, would prefer an API that is not dictated by a single vendor.

AMD's ROCm~\cite{ROCm} software platform and its Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability (HIP) language~\cite{hip} helps escaping the CUDA walled garden by providing a route out from the NVIDIA CUDA platform to AMD's devices. HIP defines a subset of CUDA that is more easily portable to various hardware, thanks mainly to omitting various advanced features available in the later CUDA versions (some of these features are discussed in Section~\ref{subsection:compatgaps}). In order to enable easy automated path from CUDA applications, HIP is largely a copy of a CUDA C/C++ subset with a few minor differences, and renamed function names. It alleviates the CUDA portability problem, but doesn't solve it satisfactorily due to AMD targeting primarily their self-specified low level ROCm APIs which have not been so far ported to other than AMD platforms. An open source CUDA/HIP software platform solely based on open standards with a sincere aim for cross-vendor portability is still lacking.

In this article we propose a complete open source software platform that enables porting applications from NVIDIA-driven CUDA and AMD-driven ROCm platforms to any platform supporting the cross-vendor open standards OpenCL and SPIR-V. We evaluate the portability aspects on platforms with proprietary drivers, and as a further contribution, extend an open source OpenCL implementation to expand the scope to further device types. In comparison to the previous solutions, our proposed platform enables usually source-modification-free compilation of HIP programs along with supporting the necessary library dependencies for the most essential CUDA/ROCm APIs. 

The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section~\ref{section:runtime} discusses the technical challenges related to the runtime execution. Section~\ref{section:compilation} describes the most relevant parts of the compiler support. Section~\ref{section:libraries} identifies the most important libraries that must be supported for compatibility, and how they are supported in the proposed software platform. Section~\ref{section:expandingCompat} shows how we expanded the platform support using open source tooling. The aspects related to directly supporting CUDA programs instead of converting them first to HIP are discussed in Section~\ref{section:directCUDA}. Debugging and profiling support is outlined in Section~\ref{section:debuggingAndProfiling}. Then we describe how the software platform portability was tested (Section~\ref{section:platformPortability}), source code portability validated (Section~\ref{section:applications}) and performance evaluated (Section~\ref{section:applications}). Section~\ref{section:relatedWork} overviews the related work to the proposed software platform and its components. 
Finally, conclusions and future work plans are presented in~\ref{section:conclusions}.

\section{Runtime}
\label{section:runtime}

\pj{TODO: aspects related to runtime, how to make it portable, mapping to OpenCL}

\subsection{Memory Management}

CUDA and HIP support device pointers embedded into other data structures in host memory.\pj{TODO: Expand this aspect. What type of host-device memory management is supported in hipstar and which CUDA version, unified shared memory etc. is not.} Implementation of this feature without a shared address space requires either tracking the device pointers and updating them before sending data to GPU, which is complex, error-prone, and in the general case impossible to perform at compile time in a watertight manner. Therefore, \textit{hipstar} requires a shared virtual address space across the host and the device(s).

\pj{TODO: OpenCL 3.0 requires coarse grained SVM of the minimal implementation, should we state it here clearly?}

Related to memory management, a requirement \textit{hipstar} places for the supported OpenCL platforms is coarse grained Shared Virtual Memory (SVM).
\pj{Michal/Henry (?) TODO: Describe how we use it. When we do unmap/map? Before and after kernel launch?}
\mb{We map at allocation time, and also at hipMemset \& hipMemcpy time. TBH does not make sense to me, but perhaps i'm missing something. At kernel launch AFAICT only the global variables are mapped/unmapped, which i think is correct. }
\pj{unmap/map is done implicitly for coarse grained SVM at command launch time, IIRC}

\pj{We should fix \url{https://github.com/CHIP-SPV/chip-spv/issues/211} and document it here ;)}
\mb{Fixing \#211 would 1) require help from backends, and also 2) we need to find out if it's legal to pass host pointers without hipHostRegister }
\pj{we discussed this yesterday with Henry, should not be possible if not unified memory is not supported by the platform, so the worst case implementation should work -- or which backend help you refer to?}

\subsection{Task Synchronization}

...
The CUDA/HIP event API does not directly map to the OpenCL event API, since in CUDA/HIP the user is responsible for creating and recording events, while in OpenCL the implementation creates and records events when queuing commands. Recording is implemented by creating a new Marker-type cl\_event (clEnqueueMarkerWithWaitList) when hipEventRecord is called. \pj{Michal (?) TO expand} \mb{not sure what else to write here}

\pj{TODO: Asynchronous stream execution.}

\subsection{Lower Layer API Interoperability}

\pj{TODO Michal, Brice (?): Describe the HIP-OpenCL and HIP-SYCL interoperability APIs and their use cases.}

The native interoperability API can be used to initialize HIP context (with assigned device \& command queue) from a set of native (LevelZero/OpenCL) object handles, or in the opposite direction to retrieve a set of native handles from an existing HIP context. Thread-safe use of handles is currently left to the application (which should be non-issue with OpenCL since it is thread-safe). Additionally, there are two APIs that create a HIP event from native event handle, and vice-versa. These can be used for chaining HIP code with native code while maintaining asynchronous execution.

%\subsection{OpenCL-CUDA/HIP Compatibility Gaps}

%\pj{Pekka TODO: This is a verbatim copy from HIPCL, to update:}
%Most of the HIP API maps trivially to the OpenCL API, with some notable exceptions which might call for new OpenCL extensions:\pj{TODO: We should just make them extensions (proposals) to clean up the story.}

%\mb{Pekka TODO: do we also list APIs which can be implemented but aren't yet (because nobody's done the work) ? looking quickly at CHIPBindings.cc, there are >50 hip API functions which have not been implemented, things like Peer2peer, hipIPC*, hipModuleOccupancy*, hipProfiler*, hipMemPool*, hip{Malloc,Free}Async etc; some might require OpenCL extensions }

%\begin{itemize}

%\item {hipGetDeviceProperties()}: for certain device properties, there is no portable way to get the information via the OpenCL device query API.\pj{this should be an easy extension}

% Pekka> I think we can do without this as it's visible only in terms
% of latency/performance to the user, and there should be also other
% similar features which can be observed only in terms of perf., not
% functional correctness (e.g. the typical concurrency to parallelism mapping).
%\item {hipSetDeviceFlags()}: the flags to this call control how the host thread interacts with the driver thread while waiting for the device (yield the host thread to OS, or spin wait).
%
%\item{hipEventCreateWithFlags()}: provides per-event control of the synchronize behaviour (yield thread/spin wait). However, these APIs affect only performance, not correctness, thus can be implemented as no-operations.

% Pekka> Cannot we really implement this without an extension even if we had kernel metadata to traverse? \mb{possibly, if we figure out the correct alignments & padding}
%\item {hipModuleLaunchKernel()}: passing args by ``extra'' parameter requires an API for setting all kernel arguments at once.\pj{a new clEnqueueNDRange variation with a HSA-style-specified exact layout argument buffer layout might be useful in any case.}

%\item {hipGraph API}: the API to create, update & launch graphs. The existing cl_khr_command_buffer extension is not sufficient, since we need to work with SVM. (discussed below in the "opencl and spirv extensions" section).

%\item {hipHostRegister}: we'll need an OpenCL extension to implement this (unless there is something already we could use, i haven't checked).

%\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Device Program Compilation}
\label{section:compilation}

% TODO: points related to compilation, how we make it portable and what type
% of LLVM transformations are needed

\subsection{Program Intermediate Representation}

A major design decision for \textit{hipstar} was to choose a \textit{portable} kernel program \textit{Intermediate Representation (IR)} format that is supported by multiple OpenCL implementations and that also has solid open source infrastructure available. While the main program of a heterogeneous application is typically compiled to a native instruction-set binary of a selected host CPU, using an IR target and ``online compilation'' for the device programs enables portability of the application binary across a diversity of co-processors. 

Overall, SPIR-V~\cite{SPIRV} seemed the best choice for the \textit{hipstar}’s ``fat binary'' format’s IR.\pj{emphasize that it's a cross-vendor committee driven standard, in good and in bad} It is supported both in later OpenCL standard as well as Vulkan. It also has good LLVM-based conversion tools available as open source. Therefore, SPIR-V support was set early on as a requirement for \textit{hipstar} supported OpenCL targets.  Unfortunately, its consumption support is not widespread in OpenCL implementations at the time of this writing, but hopefully this will change as the OpenCL implementations and input producers such as \textit{hipstar} mature. Notably, neither AMD's nor NVIDIA's OpenCL drivers support SPIR-V at the time of this writing. This should not be a significant problem in terms of HIP/CUDA portability since both platforms have direct support for them through their own implementations.

\subsection{Clang/LLVM-based Compilation Flow}

The compilation flow is based on the LLVM Project's~\cite{LLVM} Clang~\cite{Clang} frontend. The compiliation process is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:compilation}. It relies heavily on the CUDA and HIP frontend of Clang, which was updated to produce SPIR-V binaries instead of PTX or AMDIL for the device program. 

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/compilation.pdf}
    \caption{\pj{Henry (?) TODO: This is copied from HIPLZ -- redraw and adapt to the current status of \hipstar with the OpenCL in focus and Clang, LLVM tooling + the extra passes we run visible.}}
    \label{fig:compilation}
\end{figure*}

Most of the compilation related changes have been upstreamed to the LLVM project and very little compilation related functionality remains in the \hipstar project. The notable exceptions are: \pj{printf} \pj{abort} \pj{globals} \pj{what else} \pj{maybe we should implement the divergent/exited-thread barrier detection based on divergence analysis?}

\pj{Mention what was upstreamed to the LLVM Project to make hipstar work.}
\pj{Identify the hipstar-specific LLVM passes yet to upstream.}

\pj{Henry (?) TODO: Discuss the eager compilation slowness problem and how it was solved in hipstar and PoCL-level0.}

\subsection{Handling Warp-Level Primitives}

CUDA and HIP platforms have a finer grained grouping of the threads (OpenCL work-items) executing the blocks (work-groups) called a warp. In the earlier CUDA versions \pj{clarify}, the threads in a warp could be assumed to execute in lock-step, implying that the enabled threads in the same warp would execute the same instruction. This implied that in some cases explicit synchronization could be omitted: In case of a usual read-modify-update case, the programmer could trust that the warp's threads all execute the read part before any of them proceed to the update part, enabling in-place-updates without explicit synchronization. However, with the later\pj{specify} releases of CUDA relying on lock-step behavior was deprecated~\cite{NVIDIAProgrammersManual}. ...

However, the fixed size warps (32 threads for NVIDIA and usually 64 threads in AMD devices) affect the execution semantics when executing warp-level primitives that rely on the warp grouping and the mapping of the threads to the lanes of the warp.  Such primitives include the warp shuffles, which read data from a specific lane within the warp, and the explicit warp synchronization primitives. 

\pj{There could be a figure here with possible subgroup id mappings and how warps always map the threads in linear order.}
The base OpenCL specification, on the other hand, doesn't have a warp concept, but the work-items are free to make progress in any order and grouping. It has an extension called ``subgroups'' which can be used to implement the warp semantics when the kernel needs them. In contrast to  warps which have a specified form and content which allows the programmer to utilize them reliably, the basic subgroups of OpenCL are ``implementation-oriented''; they enable grouped execution in a manner that the is simplest or most efficient for the driver: The sizes of the subgroups are not fixed, but must be queried per kernel by the programmer in the basic extension. Also the way work-items are mapped to subgroup lanes (so they can be referred to when using cross-lane intrinsics) is also implementation-defined. To close the gap between subgroups and warps, an incremental specification extension \textit{cl\_intel\_reqd\_subgroup\_size} that \textit{forces} the subgroup size of the kernel to the desired size along with the linear id mapping was proposed.

% HIP doesn't support the new _sync-ones, so let's focus on it.
% Maybe also in the title of the paper.
%\pj{Pekka TODO: Non-uniform primitives.}

\subsection{Kernel Library}

\pj{Pekka TODO: This is a verbatim copy from HIPCL, to update:}
The \textit{hipstar} kernel library is an implementation of the HIP math API, by using the OpenCL C math builtins, where possible.
Many of the interfaces in the math API have an equivalent OpenCL builtin. Unfortunately, there are some functions which don't map directly, and thus require software based emulation:

\pj{TODO: About the textures implementation.}
\pj{TODO: About the CUDA intrinsics and their accuracy requirements not mapping to relaxed math limits of OpenCL and the native* OpenCL intrinsics not having any accuracy req. at all.}
\mb{TODO there is also a lot of math "intrinsics" - which i think map directly to GPU instructions in CUDA - and most of these are not implemented (a few have a native\_XYZ equivalent in OpenCL)}

\begin{itemize}

\item {Atomics on floating-points}: Do not exist in OpenCL, though they can be implemented e.g. with a CAS loop, with a performance penalty.\pj{TODO: We should. Slow is better than nothing at all.} \mb{this (CAS loop implementation) was already done in HIPCL time. There are also two SPIRV extensions: SPV\_EXT\_shader\_atomic\_float\_add \& SPV\_EXT\_shader\_atomic\_float\_min\_max, and Level Zero has an extension "ZE\_extension\_float\_atomics" so we should somehow use that. }

\end{itemize}

\subsection{OpenCL and SPIR-V Extensions}

Although the minimal OpenCL 3.0 feature set and the v1.2 of the SPIR-V OpenCL Profile\pj{?} covers most of the needs to support CUDA and HIP, some details require or improve from specification extensions. \textit{Hipstar} compilation flow is built in a way that different advanced OpenCL features and extensions are not required from the target platform's driver unless the compiled input application specifically needs them. In Table~\ref{table:extensions} we summarize the various extensions \textit{hipstar} can use and which CUDA/HIP feature triggers their need. The extensions are in different stages in the Khronos Group standardization pipeline, which is also noted in the table.~\footnote{We will update the status for the final publication.}

\section{Libraries}
\label{section:libraries}

The CUDA software platform and as implication, ROCm, include a set of useful libraries in addition to the general purpose program input. These libraries include common routines such as BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) acceleration libraries.

In order to support nearly drop-in compile-time compatibility with various applications that utilize either the CUDA or HIP libraries, we have ported a selection of them in a fashion that they can utilize and interoperate with the \textit{hipstar} platform. We discuss the libraries in the following and highlight their essential technical aspects.

\subsection{cuBLAS / hipBLAS}

\pj{TODO Peng, Sarbojit (?)}

\subsection{cuDNN / MIOpen}

\pj{TODO: SYCL-DNN. Involve Codeplay with this paper?}

\subsection{rocPRIM for CUB compatibility}

\pj{TODO: test with cub}

\subsection{CUDA Graphs / MIGraphX}

\pj{TODO: mapping the Graph API to the command buffer API}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Expanding Portability with Open Source OpenCL Implementations}
\label{section:expandingCompat}

Although OpenCL has again risen in popularity in the recent years, thanks to its more easily implementable OpenCL 3.0 version, the main portability gap is SPIR-V input, which is not mandated by the specification. As of this writing, only ARM and Intel support SPIR-V input to their GPU offerings in their proprietary drivers.

Fortunately there are now various active OpenCL implementations that can be used and expanded to fill up the lack of features in the proprietary implementations until they catch up. The two most vibrant ones are Rusticl~\cite{RustiCLWeb} and Portable Computing Language (PoCL~\cite{poclIJPP}). These two projects can be utilized to extend the portability to X and Y, and interestingly, back to CUDA platforms by using the PoCL-CUDA driver.

...
\pj{Discuss how we can have end-to-end testing with PoCL and support more targets thanks to its SPIR-V input.}
...
\pj{Looping Back to NV with PoCL-CUDA and/or RustiCL}
...
\pj{TODO: A portability graph which shows the layers, required extensions, and platforms that support it. Similar to https://github.com/pocl/pocl/files/10957913/sw-stack-graph.pdf}

\label{section:debuggingAndProfiling}

Thanks to using the open standard OpenCL as the portability layer, various debugging and profiling tooling options are available to use with little to no additional effort.

But even better, Brice, could we involve Kevin Petit to help with this? It would not be much to ask given they are getting HIP/CUDA input basically for free (well, how much benefit that has on Android platforms is questionable)...}

In this section we evaluate the performance of \textit{hipstar}  with specific focus on overheads cause by layering HIP and CUDA on top of other API layers such as OpenCL and Level Zero.

\subsection{Execution Performance}

\pj{TODO: Which apps and which GPUs we should use here?}

\subsubsection{GeekBench}

% GeekBench 5.2.3  - 
\pj{TODO: Compare to https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA, if possible}

\subsection{Layering Overheads}

\pj{TODO: Evaluate how much overhead on top of straight HIP/CUDA to CUDA vs. through PoCL-CUDA}
\pj{TODO: Evaluate how much overhead going through PoCL-level0 incurs on top of straight LZ BE}

\pj{Straight to CUDA vs. CUDA to HIP to hipstar to OpenCL + to OpenCL to PoCL-CUDA to CUDA}

\subsection{Graphs on Command Buffers}

\pj{Michal (?) TODO: numbers on command buffer benefits here?}

\pj{TODO: Comparisons}
\pj{TODO: Overhead analysis}
