%Due to NVIDIA dominating the GPU market and despite its lack of cross-vendor portability, the C/C++-based application programming interface of CUDA and its related key libraries are still used in a significant fraction of software utilizing GPU-based acceleration. AMD's ROCm and its Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability (HIP) aims to alleviate the CUDA's lack of portability by providing a route out from the NVIDIA CUDA platform to AMD's devices.

  We describe \chipstar, an open source software stack which enables building unmodified CUDA and HIP programs to binaries that rely solely on open cross-vendor standards OpenCL and SPIR-V. The relevant technical aspects of \chipstar and the feature mismatches between CUDA/HIP APIs and OpenCL are discussed along with a set of standard extension proposals to bridge the essential gaps in the future.
  The key benefit of the software stack is its portability, which is demonstrated by providing performance evaluations on a diversity of less common CPU/GPU platforms including RISC-V/PowerVR and ARM Mali. A comparison against the original AMD HIP platform provides a geometric mean of X.XX \pj{TODO (Henry)}, a reasonable price to pay for the enhanced portability.    
  Although being a relatively young open source code base, \chipstar is now considered mature enough for wider testing and even production use, which is supported by successful porting of GAMESS, a complex HPC application which was deployed in the Aurora supercomputer.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{W}{alled} garden strategy is popular among market dominating companies. Its idea is to lock-in customers to company's products by making escaping the gates of the garden as costly as possible. NVIDIA's CUDA software platform is considered to be one of such walled gardens. It in part helps NVIDIA to expand and keep a foothold of their GPU market advantage, and at the same time maintain high innovation pace on the software APIs since there is no need to work with standardization committees that always have to aim for a consensus among multiple participating vendors.

Naturally, for end-users and the competing hardware vendors, the situation of a single-vendor dictated API is not ideal. End-users would prefer open standard software interfaces that enable switching the targeted hardware without incurring significant non-recurring engineering costs required for porting the applications and libraries to a new software platform just to be able to utilize the newly purchased hardware optimally. Similarly, other hardware vendors, aiming to get their piece of the market pie, would prefer an API that is not controlled by a single vendor.

AMD's ROCm~\cite{ROCm} software platform and its Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability (HIP) language~\cite{hip} helps escaping the CUDA walled garden by providing a route out from the NVIDIA CUDA platform to AMD's devices. HIP defines a subset of CUDA that is more easily portable to various hardware, thanks mainly to omitting various advanced features available in the later CUDA versions.
%(some of these features are discussed in Section~\ref{subsection:compatgaps}).
In order to enable easy automated transition path from CUDA applications, HIP is largely a copy of a CUDA C/C++ API subset with a few minor differences and renamed functions. HIP alleviates the CUDA portability problem, but doesn't solve it satisfactorily due to AMD targeting their self-specified low level ROCm APIs which are not actively supported on non-AMD platforms.
%\kh{this is related to the other point I brought up. It can be read as AMD supporting other HW somehow, but I think the truth is, it's not supported at all, especially as of today ROCm only emits AMD GPU ISA}\pj{OK. Then "for Portability" is quite misleading today. Do you have a reference to a manual or somewhere that says the CUDA output is not supported anymore?} 
An open source HIP/CUDA software platform solely based on open standards with a sincere aim for cross-vendor portability is still lacking.

With the \chipstar software stack described in this article we aim to help the CUDA/HIP
portability challenge. In contrast to previous solutions that either require source-to-source
conversion from CUDA programs~\cite{SYCLomatic}, that can lead to costly multiple codebase maintainance, or target binary-level compatibility of existing CUDA/HIP programs~\cite{ZLUDA} that
rely on questionable reverse engineering of proprietary binary interfaces (a brittle longer-term strategy), \chipstar chooses a middle-ground approach which enables source-level compatibility of HIP/CUDA programs by compiling them to a runtime portable ``fat binary'' that utilizes solely open standards and can execute on any platform supporting the required standard features without recompilation.

With this article we make the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We publish internal design choices of a software platform \chipstar that enables porting applications from NVIDIA-driven CUDA and AMD-driven ROCm platforms to any current and future platform supporting the cross-vendor open standards OpenCL and SPIR-V,
  \item evaluate its performance in comparison to running the CUDA applications directly using NVIDIA SDK or converting the applications to a popular open-standard based CUDA alternative SYCL~\cite{SYCL} and
  \item demonstrate the usability of OpenCL as a portability layer to implement other languages/APIs on top. The portability is shown by providing performance numbers on a RISC-V CPU \& PowerVR GPU and ARM platforms as well as on discrete GPUs from all main vendors. 
\end{enumerate}

The rest of the article is structured as follows: Section~\ref{section:portabilityAPIs} discusses our rationale for choosing OpenCL~\cite{OpenCL} and its device-side program representation SPIR-V~\cite{SPIRV} as the core APIs to support runtime portability in \chipstar.
Section~\ref{section:implementation} details the key technical issues in implementing the HIP/CUDA runtime on these APIs, while Section~\ref{section:compilation} focuses on the compilation aspects. Performance evaluation results are shown in Section~\ref{section:performance}. 
Section~\ref{section:applications} presents the GAMESS porting case study using \chipstar, and finally Section~\ref{section:conclusions} concludes the article.

\section{Heterogeneous Platform Hardware Abstraction Layers}
\label{section:portabilityAPIs}

As a technical background, we provide our considerations for the ``hardware abstraction layer'' API options forming the platform portability layer for \chipstar. The discussion is split to runtime APIs used to control the execution from the host side and device program representations providing an abstraction for the kernel side programs in a portable manner. Due to the abundance of potential target devices available for acceleration, we consider it important to be able to embed the device programs in an open standard-based intermediate representation (IR) and using JIT compilation for lowering the program to the target ISA of the accelerator at deployment or launch time. This enables future-proof ``fat binaries'' which can be supported on new platforms by implementing the specification of the IR. Another alternative would be to provide only source-level
compatibility where the application needs to be recompiled for each host and a device pair of interest, hindering binary distribution.

\subsection{Runtime APIs}

In practice, both CUDA and HIP are single-vendor supported programming models.
This is reflected, for example, in their platform property APIs which define limited
queries for device properties, highlighting features in each vendor's
GPU offerings. The goal of \chipstar is to
expand the portability of applications implemented using the CUDA/HIP APIs.
Therefore, the key requirement to the underlying ``platform/device portability API'' is to
cover as many of the essential features of CUDA/HIP as possible to
provide functional correctness and to exploit the potential performance benefits.
This includes,
for example, parallel and asynchronous execution of tasks, overlapping of
data transfers with task execution, and by providing access to
shared memory communication, if available. Furthermore, the portability API
should provide services to enhance performance portability of
the implementation by allowing to query the capabilities of the
devices to tune the execution at runtime to match the target's features.

There are not a large number of choices for such a runtime API, especially
if limiting the list to alternatives that enjoy official driver support from
multiple accelerator vendors or to those that have a portable long-maintained open source
implementation. In this regard, an open standard based API that has increased
in popularity is SYCL~\cite{SYCL}. SYCL
resembles CUDA in being a C++-based single-source API and
is a potential option for a portable runtime layer.
%It diverged from its original goal of an improved C++ binding to OpenCL to a more independent ecosystem with multi-backend implementations.
However, SYCL doesn't provide a runtime API or a way to query the
features of the underlying platform to tune the execution at
runtime.
%However, we consider OpenCL being a better match for portability
%layer use since it's a lightweight C API and has proprietary driver
%support from all major vendors and defines device and platform
%queries that can be used to tune the execution at runtime.
% SYCL should also support task graphs well:
%OpenCL also has a powerful task graph abstraction that can be interfaced
%with multiple in-order and out-of-order command queues~\cite{OpenCLTLP},
%events and, more recently, the relaunch of the task graphs can
%be optimized with command buffering,

Recently, OpenMP~\cite{OpenMP} has been considered for portability layer usage and,
in fact, specifically for implementing CUDA in~\cite{10.1145/3559009.3569687}.
While OpenMP enjoys support from a wide range of vendors,
we believe OpenMP is not ideal for this use case since it doesn't
define a device-side program representation, making future-proof cross-vendor portable fat binary generation difficult. It also can be considered
a high-level ``application-programmer-facing'' API similarly to SYCL,
thus offers constructs and overheads for programmer-productivity which are unneccessary for a portability layer.

Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) is an open heterogeneous platform
specification that also defines a runtime API~\cite{HSA,HSART}.
A key differentiating feature of HSA is that it standardizes on shared virtual memory,
making system-wide virtual memory addressing a required feature from
implementations. In hindsight this requirement was likely too much
too early, as system-wide virtual memory support is only relatively recently appearing
in hardware and still usually requires explicit allocation or mapping
calls from the programmer.
For this work, HSA could have been a valid choice for
a lightweight portability layer, but activity on the specification has seized with mainly AMD using only
selected parts of it in their software stack (the ROCr runtime component).
%\kh{It might make sense to talk with Dave Airlie about HSA specifically, from what I've heard is HSA was an attempt by AMD to make something cross-vendor, but in the end they were the only one deciding/doing anything. But I was never involved in HSA myself or even cared at all. I just know that Dave has some experience there.}\pj{I was also personally somewhat involved: I attended some of the meetings and implemented the obsoleted GCCBRIG frontend for HSAIL consumption for a then-client. Indeed it was like what you say; it just didn't get enough traction from other vendors and AMD dominated and everyone saw the standarding being AMD dominated (still do) although ARM was there for instance.}

Another option to consider would be Vulkan~\cite{Vulkan} since it also
provides a compute pipeline stage which allows specifying general purpose compute
kernels. However, the
feature set of the compute kernels lacks some of the OpenCL's features such as SVM which
would require further standard extensions.
%\kh{I don't think this is a strong point, because most of the kernel features are implemented in software anyway. All of the OpenCL C builtins can be implemented in OpenCL C as done by the libclc sub-project in LLVM. Other features like Program scope variables, printf or pipes are just buffers at runtime you pass into the kernel.}\pj{Right. You can implement everything in software, but can one provide efficiency/perf. portability if the standard lacks some of the features? If we cannot pinpoint any such features (other than that people consider it even more boiler plate to write than OpenCL), I can just mention it as a valid alternative.}\kh{There might be some micro-optimization possible fine tuning the implementation to specific hardware, but the GPU code to implement those built-ins is generally quite complex anyway. I think there is value in having a OpenCL C builtin library which could output vulkan SPIR-V instead for ease of use as currently it's only supporting OpenCL SPIR-V. For rusticl + zink what happens in mesa is, that we convert OpenCL SPIR-V to nir (mesa internal IR) which then gets translated to Vulkan SPIR-V and that works perfectly fine. So I think if somebody really cared, they could make the libclc stuff output vulkan SPIR-V instead.}\pj{OK. What about "platform level features" such as SVM?} 
It might be that in the future
the feature gap gets narrower and it would become a viable option. Meanwhile, layering OpenCL on top of Vulkan is an interesting option pursued by multiple open source projects to cover the devices which previously only had Vulkan driver support.

Level Zero~\cite{l0} is an API at a similar level of abstraction as HSA and OpenCL.
However, it's currently only supported by Intel's device, thus is not suitable for future-proof cross-vendor fat binaries.
%For \chipstar, Level Zero has a benefit that it uses the open standard SPIR-V as the device program
%representation, which in fact made it relatively easy to add an option for using Level Zero directly to control Intel GPU devices as an alternative to OpenCL~\cite{HIPLZ}.

Interestingly, OpenCL was originally created to provide an open cross-vendor alternative to the proprietary CUDA GPGPU programming model. It hasn't received wide support from application developers likely because it has been considered too low level and unproductive with the driver and feature support lagging behind the proprietary alternatives. However, as demonstrated by \chipstar, thanks to the official support from multiple vendors for the minimum feature set of the version 3.0 of the standard and multiple long-maintained open source implementations available, OpenCL provides a good portability layer for implementing other higher-level programming models and APIs on top.

\subsection{Device Program Representations}
\label{subsec:deviceProgramRepresentations}

Heterogeneous platforms suffer from the problem of device-side program description portability. There is a wide range of instruction-set architectures the kernels can target, and when the program is distributed in a binary form, the targets are known only at run time.
Thus, the choice of the format in which the device programs (kernels) are stored is critical as it should cover as many of the potential targets as possible.
Furthermore, the representation should be ``future-proof'' in a sense that the produced fat binaries could be made run in entirely new platforms by only referring to the API specification.
At the time of this writing, there still seem to be no clear winning program representation in this regard and various portable implementations of application-facing APIs are resorting to very fat binaries which store copies of the device program in multiple (virtual) instruction-set architectures to cover the various targets and offloading runtimes it might encounter at execution time. This is the case with~\cite{10.1145/3559009.3569687} and originally in AdaptiveCpp~\cite{10.1145/3529538.3530005}.

Recently AdaptiveCpp started storing kernels in the LLVM~\cite{LLVM} compiler Intermediate Representation (IR) instead of storing multiple different binaries depending on the target. In this scheme, LLVM IR is lowered to various target-dependent formats at runtime at the point when the target is known~\cite{OpenSYCLfatbin}.
This approach has benefits in comparison to storing abundance of device binaries in the another alternative, and works in theory, but it is also known that LLVM IR is not supposed to be a portable program representation as it can embed target-specific intrinsics, has target specific data layout and endianness among other challenges.
LLVM IR is not guaranteed to be stable across LLVM versions, which means that the fat binaries should have access to an LLVM library of version the IR was generated with, which at worst requires to embed the LLVM library along and the required backends to the fat binary, forming an unnecessary dependency.
The problem of LLVM IR not being target-independent nor stable across LLVM versions was attempted to be addressed by earlier Standard Portable Intermediate Representation (SPIR) versions 1.2 and 2.0~\cite{SPIR2}: These first SPIR versions were designed to support OpenCL C language kernels and were based on defined versions of LLVM IR, which proved to be difficult to maintain long term.
%\pj{Ben: do you have insights on the historical reasons here?}.
The LLVM-based SPIR-versions were later obsoleted in favor of the SPIR-V~\cite{SPIRV} format.
The goal for SPIR-V is to provide a robust cross-vendor specified intermediate language which is not affected by LLVM upstream changes and that shares specification effort with the Vulkan community.

HSA specification defines an intermediate language called HSAIL and a binary representation called BRIG~\cite{HSAIL}. A key technical difference of HSAIL in comparison to the SPIR-V format \chipstar chose to use is that HSAIL had a fixed number of registers and an address space for spills unlike SPIR-V, which has infinite virtual registers due to being based on the Static Single Assignment (SSA)~\cite{SSA} representation.
Similarly to Level Zero after it, HSA made a choice to not define a higher-level programming language (like OpenCL C) for the device programs, but only standadized a low level IR.
Like is the case with the HSA runtime specification, however, the activity on the HSAIL spec has stalled.
There was also a GCC-based frontend for consuming BRIGs in a target-portable fashion, but after activity on HSA quieted, the ``BRIG frontend'' was removed from the upstream GCC source code repository in a May 2021 commit.

As a conclusion, while SPIR-V OpenCL environment support from processor vendors is not very extensive as of this writing, it seems to be still the best option for a cross-platform representation given it's an open standard defined democratically by multiple hardware vendors and is relied upon by OpenCL and Vulkan and SYCL implementations among others. 
%
Thanks to open source tooling support available and useful SPIR-V producers such as \chipstar and DPC++ appearing, the list of supported targets is expected to grow in the future.

%Since it relies on a well-specified specification, the fat binaries produced by \chipstar relying on OpenCL and SPIR-V are ``future-proof'', making it feasible to add binary-level support to new devices while only referring to the specifications.

%The two core OpenCL features required by all CUDA/HIP applications when built with \chipstar are the SPIR-V input and coarse-grain SVM, both of which are optional features of the OpenCL 3.0 standard.
%Although OpenCL has again risen in popularity in the recent years, thanks to its more easily minimally-implementable 3.0 version, as of this writing, only ARM GPUs, Intel GPUs and Intel CPUs have vendor-provided OpenCL drivers that support SPIR-V input.

%Fortunately there are various active open source OpenCL implementation projects that can be used and expanded to fill up the lack of features in the proprietary drivers at least until they catch up. The two most vibrant ones are Rusticl and Portable Computing Language (PoCL~\cite{PoCL}). These two projects were used utilized to extend the portability of \chipstar-produced fat binaries to CPU targets.

\section{Implementing HIP/CUDA on OpenCL Runtime API}
\label{section:implementation}

The primary goal for \chipstar is to support the subset of CUDA features
as defined by HIP and expanding the feature set beyond it whenever feasible
while relying on the chosen open standard APIs as much as possible.
In this section, we discuss how the OpenCL/SPIR-V specifications match with
the commonly used features of CUDA/HIP and identify the most impactful gaps
that we believe should be covered in the future.
%At the time of this writing, HIP refers to features at CUDA version 9.0
%or older.
%, thus excludes modern functionality available in later NVIDIA
%devices such as page-fault relying unified memory.

\subsection{Memory Model}

Due to their common history in GPGPU programming, CUDA/HIP and OpenCL, share various
platform and memory model abstractions. For example, ``device memory'' is the same as
``global memory'' in OpenCL terminology (``shared'' is ``local'').
To avoid confusion in terminology we use only the CUDA/HIP terms in the rest of
this article. Similarly, we refer to the original CUDA versions when talking about
functions that have their counterparts in the HIP API.

A key difference between OpenCL and CUDA that required addressing was the
fact that CUDA implicitly infers the address space of the data in the device
program side whereas in OpenCL (before v2.0) the address space must be declared explicitly.
The CUDA's implicit address space inference is similar to the 'generic'
address space concept introduced in OpenCL v2.0, which was utilized to bridge
this gap.

The simplest interface in CUDA's host-side device memory management is \func{cudaMalloc()}.
It returns a raw pointer to the targeted device's global memory, instead of an opaque handle
as is the case with OpenCL's basic buffer management functionality. This presents a small
but significant difference from the OpenCL v1.x specification for device memory management;
OpenCL v1.x only provides a buffer management API (\func{clCreateBuffer()} and others) which
returns opaque \type{cl\_mem} handles.
%
The opaque buffer handles cannot be used to implement CUDA device memory allocation
because they do not provide access to the underlying raw device address or passing addresses in other data
structures, which is allowed with the CUDA device pointers. In order to implement these
capabilities, we utilized the Shared Virtual Memory (SVM) API that first appeared in
the OpenCL v2.0. The raw pointers was the another key difference along with the
implicit address space inference which required us to lift the minimum OpenCL
version to v2.0 to support even the most basic CUDA programs.

The SVM allocation API returns a raw pointer to a shared
virtual address space region. The ``Coarse Grained buffer SVM'' (CG SVM) variant can be used to
implement the basic device memory allocation. Mapping device memory allocation to CG SVM
has a drawback that the device driver must support some of the unneeded SVM features such as
mapping the allocated regions to the virtual address space although just returning physical
device memory pointers would suffice. This means that the \chipstar implementation is actually
implementing CUDA's Unified Memory model by default. To alleviate the potential performance
impact of this, \chipstar can also use the Intel Unified Shared Memory (USM)
extension (cl\_intel\_unified\_shared\_memory), if supported by the runtime. USM enables allocating strictly
device-only allocations, but still returns virtual pointers, which can be problematic for some implementations. In order to provide an allocation API matching the basic \func{cudaMalloc()}'s needs, we introduced a new extension (cl\_ext\_buffer\_device\_address) that enables querying the raw device pointer of a cl\_mem allocation without needing to map the buffer to the same address range in the host's virtual memory. \chipstar can use any of these alternative APIs.

CUDA provides an API to \textit{pin} memory so it's kept resident in the host memory and
optionally made accessible by devices from kernel code and is not swapped out to disk. 
The primary APIs to this functionality are
\func{cudaHostAlloc()} and \func{cudaHostRegister()}. The former allocates pinned
memory directly and the latter pins a previous host allocation. \func{cudaHostAlloc()}
is simple to implement with coarse grained SVM since by the coincidence of using
a shared virtual memory allocation, the buffers are by default accessible in both the host and
the device using the same pointer. However, the allocation might not be resident for the
duration of the execution, for example, if a CPU device is allowed to swap out such
allocations. That aspect, however, is only potentially inspectable as a performance difference.
\func{cudaHostRegister()} is a bit more challenging to implement on top of CG SVM since it
allows registering a host address range to be a pinned region accessible both from the host and
the device \textit{after}
the host memory has been allocated. Since the allocation might not be originally
been allocated with the OpenCL SVM allocation API, but with a system memory allocator or even
from the stack, to implement correct functionality in this case, \chipstar creates
a shadow buffer using \func{clSVMAlloc()} and synchronizes it with the host region at
kernel start and end points. OpenCL 2.1 added a new \func{clEnqueueSVMMigrateMem()} API that enables fine grained specification of where regions of SVM are migrated, but is not useful for this case since the source of \func{cudaHostRegister()} can be any host memory area whereas the API handles only SVM allocations.
%\kh{OpenCL 2.1 added clEnqueueSVMMigrateMem to give hints to the runtime where to put the content of the buffer, might make sense to mention it here and say why it's not a good fit.}\pj{Done.}\kh{I think something at the end is missing here}
% https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/unified-memory-cuda-beginners/

The later NVIDIA architectures since compute capability 6 support on-demand page migration which
relies on hardware memory management unit (page fault based buffer migrations) for coherence
on the Unified Memory allocations. This frees the programmer from the need to perform explicit memory allocation and synchronization calls. The functionality maps to the Fine-Grained System SVM of OpenCL, but since its support by hardware and drivers is very rare at the time of this writing,
it is not yet implemented by \chipstar.

\subsection{Tasks and Events}

The semantics of CUDA \textit{streams} and the ability to execute tasks/commands
asynchronously maps well to the \textit{command queues} of OpenCL. Each stream is expected
to execute commands in-order, which matches the in-order command queue semantics of OpenCL.
Commands are allowed to execute concurrently even within in-order command queues in OpenCL,
as long as the results are not observable from the outside, enabling concurrent kernel
execution~\cite{OpenCL}.

To facilitate out-of-order execution from CUDA/HIP programs the programmer has to rely
on the explicit event synchronization and recording APIs which are implemented
using OpenCL out-of-order queues by \chipstar, if supported by the target. The CUDA/HIP event API differs from the OpenCL: In CUDA/HIP the user is responsible for explicitly creating and recording events, while in OpenCL the runtime implicitly creates events when enqueuing commands. Recording events in \chipstar is implemented by creating a new marker-type \type{cl\_event} (\func{clEnqueueMarkerWithWaitList()}) when \func{cudaEventRecord()} is called.

\subsection{Textures}

\chipstar supports only a simple subset of texture objects due to a limitation in OpenCL images. The notable differences between HIP/CUDA and OpenCL are that the texture objects are pointers to opaque C/C++ structures whereas in OpenCL/SPIR-V there is a special type per image dimensionality and that the texture objects can be loaded indirectly whereas OpenCL images can be only passed to kernels as kernel arguments. Therefore, some constructs such as the following cannot be expressed in SPIR-V:

\begin{verbatim}
  hipTextureObject_t Tx = ...;
  Ty Tv = cond ? tex2D<Ty>(Tx, X, Y) 
               : tex1D<Ty>(Tx, X)
\end{verbatim}


% Pekka> Hiding this for now. It's an interesting feature, but not strictly needed for CUDA/HIP.

%The native interoperability API can be used to initialize HIP context (with assigned device \& command queue) from a set of native (LevelZero/OpenCL) object handles, or in the opposite direction to retrieve a set of native handles from an existing HIP context. Thread-safe use of handles is currently left to the application (which should be non-issue with OpenCL since it is thread-safe). Additionally, there are two APIs that create a HIP event from native event handle, and vice-versa. These can be used for interoperability of HIP code with native code while maintaining asynchronous execution.\pj{Can we share buffers somehow between APIs? Or is that down to the "external memory extension"?}\pj{Is the SYCL interop via LZ/OpenCL, no direct API calls?}

\section{Compilation Aspects}
\label{section:compilation}

This section discusses the compilation flow used by \chipstar. We introduce the overall compilation flow, the kernel built-in library implementation and summarize our findings on the key needs to extend the OpenCL/SPIR-V standards to bridge key feature gaps between the specifications.

\subsection{The Compilation Flow}

The offline compilation flow of \chipstar is based on the LLVM Project's~\cite{LLVM} Clang~\cite{Clang} frontend. The overall compilation process is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:compilation}. It relies on the CUDA/HIP frontend of Clang, which was extended to produce SPIR-V binaries as an option to PTX or AMDIL for the device program. The LLVM \func{opt} tool is used to invoke special LLVM passes provided by \chipstar for lowering HIP features to the OpenCL-SPIR-V environment. The SPIR-V translation is performed using Khronos' LLVM-SPIRV-Translator tool.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{figs/chipstar-compilation-v2.pdf}
    \caption{The offline compilation flow.}
    \label{fig:compilation}
\end{figure*}

Most of the compilation related changes have been upstreamed to the LLVM project and very little compilation related functionality remains within the \chipstar code base. The notable exceptions are compiler passes that handle CUDA vs. OpenCL differences in \func{printf()}, implement a device side \func{abort()} feature, handling of the CUDA's device-side global variables, and an indirect memory access analyzer. The indirect memory access analyzer marks kernels that are known to not indirectly access allocations, which removes the unneccessary synchronizations for the majority of
benchmarks seen so far. Otherwise, due to the CUDA's memory model, each launcher kernel can potentially access any previously allocated buffer, inducing significant unneccessary
data synchronization overheads in the common case where the kernels only access buffers set through their arguments.

%One of the performance-impacting device program passes done in \chipstar is indirect memory
%access analysis: In CG SVM, memory consistency between device and host memories is guaranteed at
%the execution boundaries of kernel commands referring to the SVM allocation. To enforce
%data synchronization, kernels referring to the SVM allocations must either refer to the
%SVM allocations as kernel arguments, or be explicitly marked to indirectly use other
%allocations. The latter poses a challenge, since in principle any kernel can refer to any
%previous allocation as CUDA device pointers can
%be passed inside data structures or global variables.
%For CG SVM,
%OpenCL's \func{clSetKernelExecInfo()} must be used to list all potentially used SVM allocations
%that are not referred to by the argument list.
%This poses a signficant performance overhead risk since the \chipstar runtime must play it safe
%and register all possible previous allocations to any launched kernel, unless proven that the
%kernel doesn't refer to a particular allocation. For applications with a lot of allocations and
%kernels that only use subsets of the buffers, a lot of unnecessary data
%synchronizations between the host and the device memories can happen. To alleviate this
%problem for the seemingly common case of only referring to buffers in the argument list,
%\chipstar implements a kernel analyzer that 

%\pj{Henry (?) TODO: Discuss the eager compilation slowness problem and how it was solved in chipstar and PoCL-level0.}

Fig.~\ref{fig:online-compilation} shows the online compilation flow from SPIR-V to device code in \chipstar runtime. A SPIR-V module is compiled just-in-time when a kernel associated with it is launched. To enhance runtime portability, the online device builtin library provides HIP builtin function variations for different device capabilities which are linked to the user’s device programs at runtime. For example, for HIP floating-point atomics the runtime chooses between an implementation that maps them to corresponding native functions via a SPIR-V extension or emulates them via atomic exchange operations.

    \caption{The just-in-time compilation flow.}
    \label{fig:online-compilation}        
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Device Built-in Library}

The \textit{chipstar} device-side library implements the HIP math API, by using a combination of OpenCL C math builtins, OCML (part of ROCm-Device-Libs), and custom implementations.
A lot of the functions in the math API have an equivalent OpenCL builtin with adequate accuracy guarantees with a few exceptions that cannot be mapped directly, and thus require software based emulation such as floating-point atomics on some devices. The main challenge in terms of a fast yet portable implementation of the functions are due to differences in math accuracy requirements between CUDA/HIP and OpenCL: most of the standard math functions of CUDA are defined in higher accuracy than what the OpenCL standard requires.

Furthermore, CUDA/HIP defines a set of \textit{intrinsics}, which are faster yet less accurate versions of the standard functions. This exposes a further difficulty when aiming for a portable yet fast implementation: It heavily depends on the targeted platform what level of accuracy is achievable while still enabling execution time benefits. Since CUDA is inherently meant not to be cross-vendor portable, the intrinsics are defined only to match the CUDA microarchitecture in an optimal manner, which might not be the case for other devices. 

OpenCL covers the use case of accessing fast but inaccurate hardware operations by means of a relaxed mathematics flag that can be enabled at device program build time and with so called native built-in functions in the built-in kernel API. Unfortunately, neither of these are usable for implementing the CUDA intrinsics by default due to not guaranteeing enough accuracy: The relaxed math in OpenCL defines maximum rounding errors, but they are usually slightly less than what the CUDA intrinsics require. The OpenCL native built-in functions are even worse fit for this use since they guarantee nothing of the accuracy but leave it entirely up to the implementation. There is not even a possibility to query for the maximum error via a runtime API, but the accuracy must be discovered via trial-and-error or from documentation of the hardware vendor.
%\pj{TODO: Check the HIP statements of guaranteed accuracy.}

The ``correctness first'' principle requires implementing the functionality by default with guaranteed accurate enough arithmetics, which means to not receive any performance benefits of simplified implementations.
%
Correctness for the basic math functions would require software emulating them with added accuracy, of which performance impact would likely be too drastic to make \chipstar unusable for high performance workloads for which it is typically used. We chose a middle-ground where the basic math functions are implemented at the OpenCL accuracy by default and the intrinsics also utilize the default functions instead of the native functions, thus do not get any performance benefits from intrinsics. For the workloads we tested, this seemed to be a good enough solution.
We plan to optimize this aspect in the future via a new standard extension with a set of builtins that guarantee the CUDA accuracy requirements to the application programmer while enabling the targeted platform to optimize and implement them as efficiently as possible.

An LLVM pass is responsible to lowering texture object API based texture functions to OpenCL image fetches. The pass analyses endpoints of the texture objects by following their use-def and def-use chains. If the pass sees that a texture object is coming from a kernel parameter and it is only used by texture fetch calls for the same dimensionality, it will replace the texture object parameter with image and sampler parameters and translates the texture fetch calls with OpenCL image fetch calls of matching dimensionality which consume the new kernel parameter. 

\subsection{OpenCL Extensions}

\chipstar compilation flow is built in a way that different advanced OpenCL features and extensions are not required from the target platform's driver or device unless the compiled input application specifically needs them. Although the minimal OpenCL 3.0 feature set plus coarse-grained SVM and SPIR-V consumption support covers a significant part of most commonly used CUDA and HIP features, some functionalities require or can be improved with various extensions to the OpenCL or SPIR-V specifications.

    \label{table:extensions}
\end{table*}

In Table~\ref{table:extensions} we summarize the standard extensions \textit{chipstar} can utilize and which CUDA/HIP feature triggers their need. The extensions are in different stages in the Khronos Group standardization process, which is also noted in the table.\footnote{Note to reviewers: We will update the status for the final article version.}
Most of the extensions are straightforward and the brief description in the table should suffice to grasp their purpose. However, the handling of warp-level primitives calls for a bit more thorough explanation:
One of the execution model differences between CUDA to OpenCL is that CUDA presents a finer grained fixed size grouping of the threads (OpenCL work-items) than the blocks (work-groups) called a \textit{warp}. In the earlier CUDA versions, the threads in a warp could be assumed to execute in lock-step, implying that the enabled threads in the same warp would execute the same instruction. This implied that in some cases explicit synchronization could be omitted: In case of a usual read-modify-update case, the programmer could trust that the warp's threads all execute the read part before any of them proceed to the update part, enabling in-place-updates without explicit synchronization. However, with the later specification versions of CUDA relying on lock-step behavior in the program logic was deprecated~\cite{NVIDIAProgrammersManual}. ...

In addition to older CUDA programs potentially relying on the lock-step semantics to omit explicit synchronization, the fixed size warps (32 threads for NVIDIA and usually 64 threads in AMD devices) affect the execution semantics when executing warp-level functions that rely on the warp grouping and the mapping of the threads to the lanes of the warp.  Such primitives include the warp shuffles, which read data from a specific lane within the warp, and the explicit warp synchronization primitives.

%\pj{There could be a figure here with possible subgroup id mappings and how warps always map the threads in linear order.}
The OpenCL specification, on the other hand, doesn't have a warp concept, but the work-items are free to make progress in any order and grouping. It has a feature extension called ``subgroups'' which is used to implement the warp semantics in \chipstar when the kernel is detected to need it. However, in contrast to warps which have a specified form and content which allows the programmer to utilize them reliably, the basic subgroups of OpenCL are ``implementation-oriented''; they enable grouped execution in a manner that is simplest or most efficient for the driver and the hardware at hand. The sizes of the OpenCL subgroups are not fixed, but must be queried per kernel by the programmer in the basic extension. Also the way work-items are mapped to subgroup lanes (so they can be referred to when using cross-lane intrinsics) is also implementation-defined. To close the gap between subgroups and warps, a standard extension \textit{cl\_khr\_subgroup\_requirements} that \textit{forces} the subgroup size of the kernel to the desired size along with the linear id mapping was proposed.
%\kh{As Nvidia hardware generally has a warp size of 32 threads, what are the plans when OpenCL runtimes/devices can't support the size required by the CUDA application?}\pj{No plans so far. We could software-emulate different warp sizes using work-item loops/replication, but I'd rather not go there if not strictly necessary. Does RustiCL support 32-wide subgroups with NV/AMD targets?}\kh{As of today rusticl doesn't support forcing a subgroup size, but drivers are written in a way that it would be possible to do so once the appropriate CL extension is implemented. The AMD mesa driver also has a debug env variable to force 32-wide subgroups. The Intel driver chooses between 8/16/32 as it sees fit. So yeah, just a bit of code missing for it.}

%\subsection{Compiling CUDA Applications Directly}
%\label{section:directCUDA}

%While the primary goal of \chipstar is to cover the CUDA/HIP APIs to the extent defined by the HIP programmer's manual, \chipstar implementation also supports a set of CUDA APIs directly. The ability to call CUDA APIs directly drops the need for source-to-source translations when porting originally CUDA applications to the platform. This is done by simply delegating the CUDA API calls to the HIP versions, similar to what HIP does with their CUDA mapping, but in reverse.\pj{to check}

%There has been legal controversy related to APIs how they are covered by the copyright laws in the past that has made legality of direct implementations of proprietary APIs unclear. This changed with the Supreme Court of the United States ruling of April 5, 2021 in the Google LLC vs. Oracle America, Inc. case, which stated that copying the Java API for use in the Android OS was considered ``fair use'' since it was done for compatibility purposes:

%\begin{quote}
%``Google’s copying of the Java SE API, which included only those
%lines of code that were needed to allow programmers to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, was a fair
%use of that material as a matter of law.''~\cite{JavaSupreme}
%\end{quote}

%Although no code was copied directly from the NVIDIA implementation, even if it was the case we believe
%our limited implementation of the CUDA API falls well within such fair use outlined in the ruling. However, since we, the \chipstar developers are engineers, not lawyers, we wanted to be extra careful that copyrights were not disrespected in any jurisdiction when adding support for direct CUDA API calls by using an implementation approach where only the programmer's manual was consulted for the API reference when implementing the CUDA compatibility headers to the \chipstar code base.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{section:performance}

We evaluated the \chipstar speed on various OpenCL-capable CPU and GPU platforms using selections of benchmarks from the HeCbench collection~\cite{HeCbench}. All of
the results were produced using the \chipstar v1.2  release~\pj{TODO: rerun the benchmarks after the release is out}.

The HeCbench benchmark application selection criteria for each comparison was as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The application had the necessary API/language variations with an HIP version that could be built with \chipstar v1.2 and its ported libraries.
    \item For SYCL/CUDA comparisons, there must not have been significant identified performance-affecting structural or implementation differences between the SYCL/CUDA and HIP versions of the application. Some of the identified ``unfair differences'' were fixed and submitted back to the HeCbench repository \pj{TODO (Henry/Michal): a pull request of the changes.}.
    \item The application could verify its results and had to validate correctly on all platforms involved in the comparison.
    \item Applications that required hardware or OpenCL driver features that were missing or too limited on the platform were omitted.
    This mostly concerned the runs on embedded/integrated GPUs with limited memory or lack of double precision floating point support.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{SYCL/DPC++}
\label{sec:SYCL-comparison}

For this evaluation we chose a subset of benchmarks included in the HeCbench suite and compared the performance of their HIP versions of the benchmarks against the SYCL versions. 
The SYCL versions were compiled with Intel's DPC++ shipped with the oneAPI v2024.X.X release\pj{TODO}. Thanks to the  OpenCL backend of DPC++, both versions of the applications could be executed using the same OpenCL driver on the same GPUs, nicely isolating
the differences between the tested software stacks to the runtime and the
LLVM IR level device code compiler optimizations. The results of this comparison are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:intel-arc-sycl-hip} for Intel ARC A760 discrete GPU and Fig.~\ref{fig:intel-i9-igpu-chipstar-vs-sycl} for the integrated GPU of Intel's 12900 i9.

      \label{fig:intel-i9-igpu-chipstar-vs-sycl}
\end{figure}

Interestingly, although both the DPC++ and \chipstar use very similar tools and components in their runtime (OpenCL) and compilation flow (Clang/LLVM and SPIR-V as the device intermediate format), we measured significant variance in the execution performance to both directions.
We analyzed the cases with the most dramatic differences and identified various explanations:
Many of the benchmarks executed very short kernel commands, making the benchmark actually mostly measure the host API call execution speed.
For example, the ``overlay'' benchmark could be sped up significantly by switching off the profiling command queue feature. 
% that was accidentally left on by default. \hl{not accidental. Profiling is used for hipEventElapsedTime.}
In some cases the device built-ins were more optimized in \chipstar than in DPC++, in some cases it was the opposite.
For example, when we compared the \chipstar and DPC++ LLVM IRs of the device code for the ``nlll'' benchmark, we found that only \chipstar performed the if-conversion optimization that converts some of the very small branches to conditional moves, which provided significant benefits.

\subsection{CUDA on NVIDIA CUDA SDK}

Execution speed of CUDA programs compiled and ran using the NVIDIA's proprietary CUDA SDK is interesting to compare against the portable and open alternative provided by \chipstar. In this experiment we first compiled CUDA versions of the applications using CUDA SDK \pj{TODO (Henry): version} to get a baseline. The same benchmark cases (the HIP versions) were then compiled using \chipstar to the portable fat binary that uses OpenCL as the portability layer which was run with multiple alternative OpenCL options. The OpenCL options included ``PoCL-CUDA'', which is a work-in-progress OpenCL implemented using the upstream LLVM's PTX backend and libCUDA. In this case two memory allocation API options were measured for curiosity: the Coarse Grain SVM, and the buffer device address (BDA) extension. We also compared to rusticl/zink, an OpenCL implementation on top of Vulkan which implements (as of this writing) only the BDA alternative. The execution time was measured on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU with the results shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rtx3060-cudasdk-vs-pocl-vs-rusticl}.

The difference between SVN and BDA in ``lfib4'' is caused by the SVM implementation of PoCL-CUDA which uses managed allocation with virtual memory pages that are not created until accessed the first time. The slow down is due to the page faults in the kernel when it writes results to such an allocation. BDA, on the contrary, doesn't allocate virtual memory pages, thus doesn't suffer from this. Other bechmarks encounter this situation as well, but only for the first kernel execution.

\pj{TODO (Karol): Let's rerun with the latest rusticl to see if ``vanGenuchten'' is now faster.}

%Henry>The ``vanGenuchten'' explanation: Not sure what happens truly. The SPIR-V binary that gets passed to the Vulkan driver has pow() function inlined and the kernel outputs a result with more error in it (but still satisfies verification). Perhaps, rusticl/zink uses their own pow() implementation that is a bit relaxed in precision and faster? -Henry

      \label{fig:rtx3060-cudasdk-vs-pocl-vs-rusticl}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{HIP on AMD ROCm}

Since \chipstar can be viewed as a more portable implementation of HIP, it is interesting to compare its speed against the original HIP implementation from AMD. For this comparison, we utilized the HIP compiler and runtime from the AMD ROCm package version \pj{Henry TODO} as a baseline to compile and execute a set of HeCbench HIP benchmarks on an AMD Radeon Pro VII GPU. To run the \chipstar fat binaries on the same GPU, we used the rusticl OpenCL implementation on the radeonsi driver. AMD's OpenCL implementation doesn't support SPIR-V input at the time of this writing, preventing its use in this comparison for running the \chipstar binaries.

In the numbers shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:radeonprovii_rocm_vs_rusticl}, an interesting anomaly to look closer at is `pnpoly' which is more than 2.5x faster on chipStar. The reason is that ROCm is slightly faster for tile sizes smaller than 32 and for larger ones notably slower. Unfortunately for ROCm, the benchmark tracks times for the largest tile which is happends to be the slowest one on ROCm.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Offloading to Integrated GPUs}

To test the extent of portability of the runtime API layer based on the OpenCL standard, we compiled and executed sets of HeCbench applications on various platforms which included both a CPU and a GPU with capable enough OpenCL support to execute the same compiled chipStar fat binary on both devices, enabling interesting CPU-to-GPU offload speedup comparisons. The platforms and their results are presented in the following.
%The HeCbench applications were chosen using the same selection criteria as described in Section~\ref{sec:SYCL-comparison}). 

\paragraph{RISC-V CPU \& PowerVR GPU} In this experiment we utilized the VisionFive2 single board computer for building and running the benchmarks. PoCL~\cite{PoCL} was used for running the benchmarks on the CPU and the proprietary OpenCL driver from Imagination Technologies was used for the GPU.  The results are visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:intel-visionfive2-gpu-cpu}. The lower performance (0.74 geom mean) of the PowerVR GPU vs RISC-V CPU can be explained by the GPU having much less on-chip resources than most benchmarks could utilize. The CPU (JH7110) has a 32KB L1 i/dcache and a 2MB L2 cache, 4 scalar cores running at 1.5 GHz (no vector support), while the GPU has only 1 compute unit (CU) running at 600 MHz and 4KB of local memory per CU. The GPU also has a native workgroup size of only 32 (subgroup size 16), while most HeCBench benchmarks use a workgroup size ranging from 128 to 1024, leading to additional thread context switches. Furthermore, the GPU's limited local memory is used also to store images, samplers, the OpenCL constant data and pointers to global memory - in addition to the shared data of the application kernels~\cite{PowerVRPerfGuide}. 
      %{there are some benchmark outliers that are >10x slower on GPU vs CPU.
%        asmooth: allocates a local memory array of 1024 floats. This is equal to the on-chip local memory size (4KB) while the local memory is used also in other ways (see prev paragraph), so

\paragraph{Intel i9 12900} This platform has a 16-core x86-64 CPU and an Intel UHD Graphics 770 integrated GPU. OpenCL on the CPU and the GPU were supported by Intel's OpenCL drivers  \pj{TODO (Michal): driver versions}. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:intel-i9-cpu-vs-igpu}. In this platform, the offload benefits are more visible thanks to the more powerful GPU.

\paragraph{ARM Cortex A53+A73 CPU \& Mali G52 GPU} \pj{TODO (Michal): driver info.}  For the CPU, PoCL~\cite{PoCL} was used as the OpenCL driver while the GPU was supported by the ARM's proprietary OpenCL driver. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mali-vs-cortex}. A lot of applications were dropped because of limited memory in the GPU and lack of double precision floating point support \pj{TODO (Michal): pls confirm}. However, various benchmarks showed significant benefits from CPU to GPU offloading, as expected.

%\section{Supporting Newer CUDA Features}
%\label{section:directCUDA}

%HIP is a subset of CUDA features, roughly at version 8~\pj{check this}. Thus, it doesn't include support some of the newer features which can utilize some of the more advanced capabilities of the NVIDIA GPU platforms. Some of these features are difficult to implement efficiently on other vendors' GPU features, and since GPU offloading is primarily done with performance improvements in mind, a functional, but inefficient implementation is less interesting.

%However, for the purpose of completeness, it is interesting to highlight some of the more useful newer features in later CUDA versions, and consider implementation strategies for future work.

%\pj{Discuss features specific to CUDA, from the doc I wrote in Parmance.}

% TODO: the OpenCL extensions identified and proposed.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusions}

In this article, we presented \chipstar, a compilation flow and a runtime for CUDA/HIP applications using open cross-vendor supported standards. In comparison to previous tools, \chipstar's goal is on source-level compatiblity which we believe has longer-term robustness benefits in comparison to binary translation. Whereas relying on standardized APIs has its drawbacks in shorter term due to the cross-vendor ``democratic concensus'' requirement, in terms of building open and fair heterogeneous computing ecosystem of the future, we consider using and expanding open standards aiming at the portability layer level has also significant far-reaching value.

The performance of HIP benchmarks using \chipstar was shown to be on par or surpass their SYCL versions when using a compiler/runtime with similar components (OpenCL and SPIR-V). An example of the source-level compatibilty was provided with GAMESS, a code base with a significant number of kernel code lines. This demonstrates that \chipstar is a useful option for applications that are not feasible to port to more cross-vendor supported open standard input APIs such as SYCL or OpenMP.

In the future, as \chipstar focuses on the HIP/CUDA API/language support, the main aspect that requires more engineering work is to expand the directly supported set of core libraries in the CUDA and HIP ecosystems to cover more real-world applications. On the HIP/CUDA core front, we aim to focus on the more advanced recent features such as collaborative groups as well as the standard extensions to bridge the remaining gaps between CUDA/HIP and OpenCL/SPIR-V.

\pj{Notes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I merged the hipBLAS description to GAMESS for now.
 %   \item I removed the debugging/profiling section. Not enough sensible content. We should state somewhere that thanks to using OpenCL we can use any tools that can profile OpenCL. Using the CPU target helps in debugging thanks to running gdb.
 %   \item Can we add more porting case studies which demonstrate something different than GAMESS? CP2K? Is the pruned-down Pytorch-HIP sensible or too pruned down? Exabiome?
    \item I removed the Libraries section as there was too little technical content. cuBLAS is too brief and highlights the negative fact that we support only a small subset of the NVIDIA or AMD ecosystem libraries.
\end{itemize}}

\pj{todo:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We should add more pictures. It's too much of text without pics. Anyone any idea of what and where?
    \item The article still reads a bit as a ``technical report'' instead of a ``scientific paper''. For more "scientific content" we should add a bit more complex technical content of some more trickier aspects, e.g., about the Graph implementation using command buffers. Ideas?
\end{itemize}}
