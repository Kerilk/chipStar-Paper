abstract = {Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability (HIP), is an open-source C++ runtime API and a kernel language. It is designed to be compatible with CUDA and to deliver close to native performance on CUDA platforms while exposing additional low-level hardware features. A key use case of HIP is in providing a portability route out from the NVIDIA CUDA platform, which is highlighted with an automated tool that can convert CUDA applications to HIP programs.In this work we describe HIPCL, a new tool which allows running HIP programs on OpenCL platforms with sufficient capabilities. HIPCL thus expands the scope of the CUDA portability route from AMD ROCm platform supported targets to platforms with advanced OpenCL support. We highlight the implementation challenges of HIPCL related to the feature mismatches between CUDA and OpenCL and exemplify its runtime overheads in comparison to directly executing OpenCL applications.},

title = "MCUDA: An efficient implementation of CUDA kernels for multi-core CPUs",
abstract = "CUDA is a data parallel programming model that supports several key abstractions - thread blocks, hierarchical memory and barrier synchronization - for writing applications. This model has proven effective in programming GPUs. In this paper we describe a framework called MCUDA, which allows CUDA programs to be executed efficiently on shared memory, multi-core CPUs. Our framework consists of a set of source-level compiler transformations and a runtime system for parallel execution. Preserving program semantics, the compiler transforms threaded SPMD functions into explicit loops, performs fission to eliminate barrier synchronizations, and converts scalar references to thread-local data to replicated vector references. We describe an implementation of this framework and demonstrate performance approaching that achievable from manually parallelized and optimized C code. With these results, we argue that CUDA can be an effective data-parallel programming model for more than just GPU architectures.",
