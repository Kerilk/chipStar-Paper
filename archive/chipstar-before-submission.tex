\begin{abstract}
%\pj{This first paragraph is optional, we can remove it:}
%Due to NVIDIA dominating the GPU market and despite its lack of cross-vendor portability, the C/C++-based application programming interface of CUDA and its related key libraries are still used in a significant fraction of software utilizing GPU-based acceleration. AMD's ROCm and its Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability (HIP) aims to alleviate the CUDA's lack of portability by providing a route out from the NVIDIA CUDA platform to AMD's devices.

We describe \chipstar, an open source software stack that enables building unmodified CUDA and HIP programs into binaries that rely solely on open cross-vendor compute standards OpenCL and SPIR-V. The relevant technical aspects of \chipstar and the feature mismatches between the CUDA/HIP APIs and OpenCL are discussed along with a set of standard extension proposals to bridge the essential gaps in the future.
The key benefit of the software stack is its portability, which is demonstrated by providing performance evaluations on a diversity of less common CPU/GPU platforms including RISC-V/PowerVR and ARM Mali. A comparison against the original AMD HIP platform provides a geometric mean of 0.75, a reasonable price to pay for the enhanced portability.    
%Although being a relatively young open source code base, 
\chipstar is now considered mature enough for wider testing and even production use, which is demonstrated by successful porting and competitive performance of GAMESS-GPU-HF,

%\section{Introduction}

\noindent The walled garden strategy is popular among market-dominating companies. The idea behind walled garden strategy is to lock in customers to a company's products by making escaping the gates of the garden as costly as possible. NVIDIA's CUDA software platform is considered to be one of such walled gardens. It helps NVIDIA to expand and retain their GPU market advantage, and at the same time maintain a high innovation pace on the software APIs since there is no need to work with standardization committees that always have to aim for a consensus among multiple participating vendors.

Naturally, for end-users and the competing hardware vendors, the situation of a single-vendor dictated API is not ideal. End-users would prefer open standard software interfaces that enable switching the targeted hardware without incurring significant non-recurring engineering costs required for porting the applications and libraries to a new software platform just to be able to utilize the newly purchased hardware optimally. Similarly, other hardware vendors, aiming to get their piece of the market pie, would prefer an API that is not controlled by a single vendor.

AMD's ROCm~\cite{ROCm} software platform and its Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability (HIP) language~\cite{hip} helps escaping the CUDA walled garden by providing a route out from the NVIDIA CUDA platform to AMD's devices. HIP defines a subset of CUDA that is more easily portable to various hardware, thanks mainly to omitting various advanced features available in the later CUDA versions.

%(some of these features are discussed in Section~\ref{subsection:com\textbf{}patgaps}).
In order to enable an easy automated transition path from CUDA applications, HIP is largely a copy of a CUDA C/C++ API subset with a few minor differences and renamed functions. HIP alleviates the CUDA portability problem, but doesn't solve it satisfactorily due to AMD targeting their self-specified low-level ROCm APIs which are not actively supported on non-AMD platforms.
%\kh{this is related to the other point I brought up. It can be read as AMD supporting other HW somehow, but I think the truth is, it's not supported at all, especially as of today ROCm only emits AMD GPU ISA}
%\pj{OK. Then "for Portability" is quite misleading today. Do you have a reference to a manual or somewhere that says the CUDA output is not supported anymore?} 
%\pv{CUDA output is still suported though there was a bug in it for a while which definitely indicates that portability is an afterthought for AMD}
An open source HIP/CUDA software platform solely based on open standards with a sincere aim for cross-vendor portability is still lacking.

With the \chipstar software stack described in this article we aim to alleviate the CUDA/HIP application
portability problem. In contrast to previous solutions that either require source-to-source conversion from CUDA programs~\cite{SYCLomatic}, that can lead to costly multiple codebase maintenance, or aim for binary-level compatibility of existing CUDA/HIP programs~\cite{ZLUDA} that rely on questionable reverse engineering of proprietary binary interfaces -- a brittle longer-term strategy -- \chipstar chooses a middle-ground approach which enables source-level compatibility of HIP/CUDA programs by compiling them to a runtime portable ``fat binary'' that utilizes solely open standards and can execute on any platform supporting the required standard features without recompilation.

With this article and the associated open source code base we make the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We publish internal design choices for the software platform \chipstar that enables porting applications from the NVIDIA-driven CUDA and AMD-driven ROCm platforms to any current and future platform supporting the OpenCL and SPIR-V cross-vendor open standards.
  \item We evaluated \chipstar performance in comparison to running the CUDA applications directly using the NVIDIA SDK or converting the applications to a popular open-standard-based CUDA alternative SYCL.
  %~\cite{SYCL}
  \item We demonstrate a case study for the usability of OpenCL as a portability layer to implement other languages/APIs on top. Portability is shown by providing performance numbers on a RISC-V CPU \& PowerVR GPU,  ARM CPU and GPU, as well as on discrete GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel. 
\end{enumerate}

The rest of the article is structured as follows: Section~\ref{section:portabilityAPIs} discusses our rationale for choosing OpenCL~\cite{OpenCL} and its device-side program representation SPIR-V~\cite{SPIRV} as the core APIs to support runtime portability in \chipstar.
Section~\ref{section:implementation} details the key technical issues in implementing the HIP/CUDA runtime on these APIs, while Section~\ref{section:compilation} focuses on the compilation aspects. Performance evaluation results are shown in Section~\ref{section:performance}. 
Section~\ref{section:applications} presents the GAMESS-GPU-HF porting case study using \chipstar, and finally Section~\ref{section:conclusions} concludes the article.

\section{Heterogeneous Platform Hardware Abstraction Layers}
\label{section:portabilityAPIs}

As a technical background, we provide our considerations for the ``hardware abstraction layer'' API options forming the platform portability layer for \chipstar. The discussion is split into 1) runtime APIs used to control the execution from the host side and 2) device program representations providing an abstraction for the kernel side programs in a portable manner. Due to the abundance of potential target devices available for acceleration, we consider it important to be able to embed the device programs in an open standard-based intermediate representation (IR) and to use JIT compilation for lowering the program to the target ISA of the accelerator at deployment or launch time. This enables future-proof ``fat binaries'' which can be supported on new platforms by implementing the specification of the IR. Another alternative would be to provide only source-level
compatibility where the application needs to be recompiled for each host and a device pair of interest, hindering binary distribution.

\subsection{Runtime APIs}

In practice, both CUDA and HIP are single-vendor supported programming models.
This is reflected, for example, in their platform property APIs which define limited
queries for device properties, highlighting features in each vendor's
GPU offerings. The goal of \chipstar is to
expand the portability of applications implemented using the CUDA/HIP APIs.
Therefore, the key requirement to the underlying ``platform/device portability API'' is to
cover as many of the essential features of CUDA/HIP as possible to
provide functional correctness and to exploit the potential performance benefits.
This includes,
for example, parallel and asynchronous execution of tasks, overlapping of
data transfers with task execution, and by providing access to
shared memory communication, if available. Furthermore, the portability API
should provide services to enhance performance portability of
the implementation by allowing to query the capabilities of the
devices to tune the execution at runtime to match the target's features.

There are not a large number of choices for such a runtime API, especially
if limiting the list to alternatives that enjoy official driver support from
multiple accelerator vendors or to those that have a portable long-maintained open source implementation. In this regard, an open standard based API that has increased in popularity is SYCL~\cite{SYCL}. SYCL
resembles CUDA in being a C++-based single-source API. However, as a layer for supporting other languages on top, it lacks means to explicitly load and launch pre-built kernels defined in non-SYCL language at host runtime. It has an interoperability layer that allows one to build OpenCL C kernels, but then the additional value of using SYCL as a portability layer instead of using OpenCL directly is not obvious.
%It diverged from its original goal of an improved C++ binding to OpenCL to a more independent ecosystem with multi-backend implementations.

%However, SYCL doesn't provide a runtime API or a way to query the
%features of the underlying platform to tune the execution at
%runtime.
%\ba{I don't undrstand this sentence.  What is missing from SYCL that is in other runtime APIs?  An example might help.} 
%\pv{Yeah I couldn't find this missing functionality, removing the last sentence.
%However, we consider OpenCL being a better match for portability
%layer use since it's a lightweight C API and has proprietary driver
%support from all major vendors and defines device and platform
%queries that can be used to tune the execution at runtime.
% SYCL should also support task graphs well:
%OpenCL also has a powerful task graph abstraction that can be interfaced
%with multiple in-order and out-of-order command queues~\cite{OpenCLTLP},
%events and, more recently, the relaunch of the task graphs can
%be optimized with command buffering,
%\pj{I added a sentence which I think is a core matter here.}

Recently, OpenMP~\cite{OpenMP} has been considered for portability layer usage and,
in fact, specifically for implementing CUDA in~\cite{10.1145/3559009.3569687}.
While OpenMP enjoys support from a wide range of vendors,
we believe OpenMP is not ideal for this use case since it doesn't
define a device-side program representation, making future-proof cross-vendor portable fat binary generation difficult. It also can be considered
a high-level ``application-programmer-facing'' API similarly to SYCL,
thus offers constructs and overheads for programmer-productivity which are unneccessary for a portability layer.

Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) is an open heterogeneous platform
specification that also defines a runtime API~\cite{HSA,HSART}.
A key differentiating feature of HSA is that it standardizes on shared virtual memory,
making system-wide virtual memory addressing a required feature from
implementations. In hindsight this requirement was too much
too early, as system-wide virtual memory support is only recently appearing
in hardware and still usually requires explicit allocation or mapping
calls from the programmer.
For this work, HSA could have been a valid choice for
a lightweight portability layer, but activity on the specification has ceased.
%\cb{The use of "seized" here seems a little strange to me here, can someone clarify the meaning?}  mispelled
with mainly AMD using only selected parts of it in their software stack (the ROCr runtime component).
%\kh{It might make sense to talk with Dave Airlie about HSA specifically, from what I've heard is HSA was an attempt by AMD to make something cross-vendor, but in the end they were the only one deciding/doing anything. But I was never involved in HSA myself or even cared at all. I just know that Dave has some experience there.}\pj{I was also personally somewhat involved: I attended some of the meetings and implemented the obsoleted GCCBRIG frontend for HSAIL consumption for a then-client. Indeed it was like what you say; it just didn't get enough traction from other vendors and AMD dominated and everyone saw the standarding being AMD dominated (still do) although ARM was there for instance.}

Another option to consider would be Vulkan~\cite{Vulkan} since it also
provides a compute pipeline stage which allows specifying general purpose compute
kernels. However, the
feature set of the compute kernels lacks some of OpenCL's features such as SVM which
would require further standard extensions.
%\kh{I don't think this is a strong point, because most of the kernel features are implemented in software anyway. All of the OpenCL C built-ins can be implemented in OpenCL C as done by the libclc sub-project in LLVM. Other features like Program scope variables, printf or pipes are just buffers at runtime you pass into the kernel.}\pj{Right. You can implement everything in software, but can one provide efficiency/perf. portability if the standard lacks some of the features? If we cannot pinpoint any such features (other than that people consider it even more boiler plate to write than OpenCL), I can just mention it as a valid alternative.}\kh{There might be some micro-optimization possible fine tuning the implementation to specific hardware, but the GPU code to implement those built-ins is generally quite complex anyway. I think there is value in having a OpenCL C built-in library which could output vulkan SPIR-V instead for ease of use as currently it's only supporting OpenCL SPIR-V. For rusticl + zink what happens in mesa is, that we convert OpenCL SPIR-V to nir (mesa internal IR) which then gets translated to Vulkan SPIR-V and that works perfectly fine. So I think if somebody really cared, they could make the libclc stuff output vulkan SPIR-V instead.}\pj{OK. What about "platform level features" such as SVM?} 
It might be that in the future
the feature gap gets narrower and it would become a viable option. Meanwhile, layering OpenCL on top of Vulkan is an interesting option pursued by multiple open source projects to cover the devices which previously only had Vulkan driver support.

Level Zero~\cite{l0} is an API at a similar level of abstraction as HSA and OpenCL.
However, it's currently only supported on Intel's devices, thus is not suitable for future-proof cross-vendor fat binaries.
%For \chipstar, Level Zero has a benefit that it uses the open standard SPIR-V as the device program
%representation, which in fact made it relatively easy to add an option for using Level Zero directly to control Intel GPU devices as an alternative to OpenCL~\cite{HIPLZ}.

Interestingly, OpenCL was originally created to provide an open cross-vendor alternative to the proprietary CUDA GPGPU (General Purpose GPU) programming model. It has received wide support from hardware vendors, but some application developers are known to dislike it because it can be considered too low level as an application-facing API and unproductive with the driver and feature support lagging behind the proprietary alternatives. %However, as demonstrated by \chipstar, thanks to the official support from multiple vendors for the minimum feature set of the version 3.0 of the standard and multiple long-maintained open source implementations available, OpenCL provides an excellent portability layer for implementing other higher-level programming models and APIs on top.
However, as demonstrated in this paper, OpenCL can provide an excellent portability layer for implementing other higher-level programming models and APIs on top. This portability is due to multiple vendor's official support for the minimum feature set of OpenCL version 3.0 and to multiple long-maintained open source implementations. For these reasons, we have chosen OpenCL as the runtime through which to access the GPU.
%\cb{"Thus we chose to use OpenCL as a runtime for \chipstar" or something to be very clear about the point}

\subsection{Device Program Representations}
\label{subsec:deviceProgramRepresentations}

Heterogeneous platforms suffer from the problem of device-side program description portability. There is a wide range of instruction-set architectures the kernels can target, and when the program is distributed in a binary form, the targets are known only at run time.
Thus, the choice of the format in which the device programs (kernels) are stored is critical as it should cover as many of the potential targets as possible.
Furthermore, the representation should be ``future-proof'' in a sense that the produced fat binaries could be made to run on entirely new platforms by only referring to the API specification.
At the time of this writing, there still seems to be no clear winning program representation in this regard. Various portable implementations of application-facing APIs resort to very fat binaries which store copies of the device program in multiple (virtual) instruction-set architectures to cover the various targets and offloading runtimes it might encounter at execution time. This is the case with~\cite{10.1145/3559009.3569687} and originally in AdaptiveCpp~\cite{10.1145/3529538.3530005}.

Recently AdaptiveCpp started storing kernels in the LLVM~\cite{LLVM} compiler Intermediate Representation (IR) instead of storing multiple different binaries depending on the target. In this scheme, LLVM IR is lowered to various target-dependent formats at runtime at the point when the target is known~\cite{OpenSYCLfatbin}.
This approach has benefits in comparison to storing abundance of device binaries in the another alternative, and works in theory, but it is also known that LLVM IR is not supposed to be a portable program representation as it can embed target-specific intrinsics, has target specific data layout and endianness among other challenges.
LLVM IR is not guaranteed to be stable across LLVM versions, which means that the fat binaries should have access to an LLVM library of version the IR was generated with, which at worst requires to embed the LLVM library along and the required backends to the fat binary, forming an unnecessary dependency.
The problem of LLVM IR not being target-independent nor stable across LLVM versions was attempted to be addressed by earlier Standard Portable Intermediate Representation (SPIR) versions 1.2 and 2.0~\cite{SPIR2}: These first SPIR versions were designed to support OpenCL C language kernels and were based on defined versions of LLVM IR, which proved to be difficult to maintain long term.
%\pj{Ben: do you have insights on the historical reasons here?}.
LLVM-based SPIR versions were later obsoleted in favor of the SPIR-V~\cite{SPIRV} format.
The goal for SPIR-V is to provide a robust cross-vendor specified intermediate language which is not affected by LLVM upstream changes and that shares specification effort with the Vulkan community.

HSA specification defines an intermediate language called HSAIL and a binary representation called BRIG~\cite{HSAIL}. A key technical difference between HSAIL and SPIR-V format, is that HSAIL has 
% \cb{should it be "has"? or is there a reason it's past tensed?}  Likely becuase it's kind of dead? but yeah the definition of it still remains so changed it to has. -pv
a fixed number of registers and an address space for spills unlike SPIR-V, which has infinite virtual registers due to being based on the Static Single Assignment (SSA)~\cite{SSA} representation.
%\cb{I don't know if it makes sense to mention LZ here, since LZ doesn't have a low-level or high-level kernel language. maybe will confuse things, I would remove the reference},  Agree, -pv
HSA made a choice to not define a higher-level programming language (like OpenCL C) for the device programs, but only standardized a low level IR.
As with the HSA runtime specification, however, the activity on the HSAIL specification has stalled.
There was also a GCC-based frontend for consuming BRIGs in a target-portable fashion, but after activity on HSA quieted, the ``BRIG frontend'' was removed from the upstream GCC source code repository in a May 2021 commit.

In conclusion, while official SPIR-V OpenCL environment support from processor vendors is extensive as of this writing, it seems to be still the best option for a cross-platform representation given that it is an open standard defined democratically by multiple hardware vendors and is relied upon by OpenCL, Vulkan, and SYCL implementations among other use cases such as Direct-X adopting it. 
%Thus we chose to use SPIR-V as a device program representation in \chipstar.
%
In addition, thanks to open source tooling support available and useful SPIR-V producers such as \chipstar and Intel oneAPI DPC++ appearing, the list of supported targets is expected to grow in the future. Therefore, we considered SPIR-V and OpenCL to be future-proof open standards on which to base the implementation.

%\cb{I think we need some clear statement like "and thus we shose OpenCL as the runtime and SPIR-V as the device representation." I added in a line for SPIRV but maybe we need to be more clear.}
%\pv{I think it's ok now? Both sections explain and end in 'thus we choose x'}
%\pj{I added one sentence to the end to summarize. THe previous paragraph was actually only about SPIR-V (and its CL profiöle) and not about OpenCL.}
%Since it relies on a well-specified specification, the fat binaries produced by \chipstar relying on OpenCL and SPIR-V are ``future-proof'', making it feasible to add binary-level support to new devices while only referring to the specifications.

%The two core OpenCL features required by all CUDA/HIP applications when built with \chipstar are the SPIR-V input and coarse-grain SVM, both of which are optional features of the OpenCL 3.0 standard.
%Although OpenCL has again risen in popularity in the recent years, thanks to its more easily minimally-implementable 3.0 version, as of this writing, only ARM GPUs, Intel GPUs and Intel CPUs have vendor-provided OpenCL drivers that support SPIR-V input.

%\pv{this is interesting - why comment it out? Also  what about RISCV}

%Fortunately there are various active open source OpenCL implementation projects that can be used and expanded to fill up the lack of features in the proprietary drivers at least until they catch up. The two most vibrant ones are Rusticl and Portable Computing Language (PoCL~\cite{PoCL}). These two projects were used utilized to extend the portability of \chipstar-produced fat binaries to CPU targets.

\section{Implementing HIP/CUDA on OpenCL Runtime API}
\label{section:implementation}

The primary goal for \chipstar is to support the subset of CUDA features
as defined by HIP and expand the feature set beyond it whenever feasible
while relying on the chosen open standard APIs as much as possible.
In this section, we discuss how the OpenCL/SPIR-V specifications can be matched with
the commonly used features of CUDA/HIP and identify the most impactful gaps
that we believe should be covered in the future.
%At the time of this writing, HIP refers to features at CUDA version 9.0
%or older.
%, thus excludes modern functionality available in later NVIDIA
%devices such as page-fault relying unified memory.

\subsection{Memory Model}

Due to their common history in GPGPU programming, CUDA/HIP and OpenCL share various
platform and memory model abstractions. For example, ``device memory'' is the same as
``global memory'' in OpenCL terminology (``shared'' is ``local'').
To avoid confusion in terminology we use only the CUDA/HIP terms in the rest of
this article. Similarly, we refer to the original CUDA versions when talking about
functions that have their counterparts in the HIP API.

A key difference between OpenCL and CUDA that required addressing is the
fact that CUDA implicitly infers the address space of the data in the device
program side whereas in OpenCL (before v2.0) the address space must be declared explicitly.
The CUDA's implicit address space inference is similar to the 'generic'
address space concept introduced in OpenCL v2.0, which was utilized to bridge
this gap.

The simplest interface in CUDA's host-side device memory management is \func{cudaMalloc()}.
It returns a raw pointer to the targeted device's global memory, instead of an opaque handle
as is the case with OpenCL's basic buffer management functionality. This presents a small
but significant difference from the OpenCL v1.x specification for device memory management;
OpenCL v1.x only provides a buffer management API (\func{clCreateBuffer()} and others) which
returns opaque \type{cl\_mem} handles.
%
The opaque buffer handles cannot be used to implement CUDA device memory allocation
because they do not provide access to the underlying raw device address or passing addresses in other data
structures, which is allowed with the CUDA device pointers. In order to implement these
capabilities, we utilized the Shared Virtual Memory (SVM) API that first appeared in
the OpenCL v2.0. %The raw pointers was the another key difference along with theimplicit address space inference which required us to lift the minimum OpenCL version to v2.0 to support even the most basic CUDA programs.
The raw pointers vs buffers difference along with the
implicit address space inference required us to lift the minimum OpenCL
version to v2.0 to support even the most basic CUDA programs.

The SVM allocation API returns a raw pointer to a shared
virtual address space region. The ``Coarse Grained buffer SVM'' (CG SVM) variant can be used to
implement the basic device memory allocation. Mapping device memory allocation to CG SVM
has a drawback that the device driver must support some of the unneeded SVM features such as
mapping the allocated regions to the virtual address space although just returning physical
device memory pointers would suffice. This means that the \chipstar implementation is actually
implementing CUDA's Unified Memory model by default. To alleviate the potential performance
impact of this, \chipstar can also use the Intel Unified Shared Memory (USM)
extension (\textit{cl\_intel\_unified\_shared\_memory} \cite{intel-usm} ), if supported by the runtime. USM enables allocating strictly
device-only allocations, but still returns virtual pointers, which can be problematic for some implementations. In order to provide an allocation API matching the basic \func{cudaMalloc()}'s needs, we introduced a new extension (\textit{cl\_ext\_buffer\_device\_address}  \cite{intel-buffer}) that enables querying the raw device pointer of a cl\_mem allocation without needing to map the buffer to the same address range in the host's virtual memory. \chipstar can use any of these alternative memory management APIs, if advertised by the targeted OpenCL device.

CUDA provides an API to \textit{pin} memory so it's kept resident in the host memory and
optionally made accessible by devices from kernel code and is not swapped out to disk. 
The primary APIs to this functionality are
\func{cudaHostAlloc()} and \func{cudaHostRegister()}. The former allocates pinned
memory directly and the latter pins a previous host allocation. \func{cudaHostAlloc()}
is simple to implement with coarse grained SVM since by the coincidence of using
a shared virtual memory allocation, the buffers are by default accessible in both the host and
the device using the same pointer. However, the allocation might not be resident for the
duration of the execution, for example, if a CPU device is allowed to swap out such
allocations. However, that aspect can only be observed by the programmer as a performance difference.

\func{cudaHostRegister()} is a bit more challenging to implement on top of CG SVM since it
allows registering a host address range to be a pinned region accessible both from the host and
the device \textit{after}
the host memory has been allocated. Since the allocation might not have
been originally allocated with the OpenCL SVM allocation API, but with a system memory allocator or even
from the stack, to implement correct functionality in this case, \chipstar creates
a shadow buffer using \func{clSVMAlloc()} and synchronizes it with the host region at
kernel start and end points. OpenCL 2.1 added a new \func{clEnqueueSVMMigrateMem()} API that enables fine grained specification of where regions of SVM are migrated, but it is not useful for this case since the source of \func{cudaHostRegister()} can be any host memory area whereas the API handles only SVM allocations.
%\kh{OpenCL 2.1 added clEnqueueSVMMigrateMem to give hints to the runtime where to put the content of the buffer, might make sense to mention it here and say why it's not a good fit.}\pj{Done.}\kh{I think something at the end is missing here}
% https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/unified-memory-cuda-beginners/

The NVIDIA architectures post-compute capability 6 support on-demand page migration which
relies on the hardware memory management unit (page fault-based buffer migrations) for coherence
of the Unified Memory allocations. This frees the programmer from the need to perform explicit memory allocation and synchronization calls. This functionality maps to the Fine-Grained System SVM of OpenCL, but since hardware and driver support for fine-grain SVM is very rare at the time of this writing, on-demand page migration is not yet implemented by \chipstar.

The semantics of CUDA \textit{streams} and the ability to execute tasks/commands
asynchronously maps well to the \textit{command queues} of OpenCL. Each stream is expected
to execute commands in-order, which matches the in-order command queue semantics of OpenCL.
Commands are allowed to execute concurrently even within in-order command queues in OpenCL,
as long as the results are not observable from the outside, enabling concurrent kernel
execution~\cite{OpenCL}.

%To facilitate out-of-order execution from CUDA/HIP programs the programmer has to rely
%on the explicit event synchronization and recording APIs which are implemented
%using OpenCL \pv{we don't use out-of-order queues}\pj{OK. The whole paragraph is wrong then?} \pv{CUDA streams are in-order and so are streams in chipStar. Yes, this paragraph is wrong  unless the author meant something else by in-order vs out-of-order} out-of-order queues by \chipstar, if supported by the target. The CUDA/HIP event API differs from the OpenCL: In CUDA/HIP the user is responsible for explicitly creating and recording events, while in OpenCL the runtime implicitly creates events when enqueuing commands. Recording events in \chipstar is implemented by creating a new marker-type \type{cl\_event} (\func{clEnqueueMarkerWithWaitList()}) when \func{cudaEventRecord()} is called.

\subsection{Textures}

\chipstar supports only a subset of texture objects due to a limitation in OpenCL images. The notable differences between HIP/CUDA and OpenCL are that the texture objects are pointers to opaque C/C++ structures whereas in OpenCL/SPIR-V there is a special type per image dimensionality and that the texture objects can be loaded indirectly whereas OpenCL images can be only passed to kernels as kernel arguments. Therefore, some constructs such as the following cannot be expressed in SPIR-V:

\begin{verbatim}
  hipTextureObject_t Tx = ...;
  Ty Tv = cond ? tex2D<Ty>(Tx, X, Y) 
               : tex1D<Ty>(Tx, X)
\end{verbatim}
%\pv{relocated the out-of-place texture paragraph}
An LLVM pass is responsible for lowering texture object API based texture functions to OpenCL image fetches. The pass analyses endpoints of the texture objects by following their use-def and def-use chains. If the pass sees that a texture object is coming from a kernel parameter and it is only used by texture fetch calls for the same dimensionality, it will replace the texture object parameter with image and sampler parameters and translates the texture fetch calls with OpenCL image fetch calls of matching dimensionality which consume the new kernel parameter. 

% Pekka> Hiding this for now. It's an interesting feature, but not strictly needed for CUDA/HIP.
%\subsection{Lower Layer API Interoperability}

%\pj{TODO Sarbojit: Describe the HIP-OpenCL and HIP-SYCL interoperability APIs and their use cases.}
%\pj{Can you add code examples of using the different interop APIs?}

%The native interoperability API can be used to initialize HIP context (with assigned device \& command queue) from a set of native (LevelZero/OpenCL) object handles, or in the opposite direction to retrieve a set of native handles from an existing HIP context. Thread-safe use of handles is currently left to the application (which should be non-issue with OpenCL since it is thread-safe). Additionally, there are two APIs that create a HIP event from native event handle, and vice-versa. These can be used for interoperability of HIP code with native code while maintaining asynchronous execution.\pj{Can we share buffers somehow between APIs? Or is that down to the "external memory extension"?}\pj{Is the SYCL interop via LZ/OpenCL, no direct API calls?}

%\subsection{OpenCL-CUDA/HIP Compatibility Gaps}

%\pj{Pekka: This is a verbatim copy from HIPCL, to update:}
%Most of the HIP API maps trivially to the OpenCL API, with some notable exceptions which might call for new OpenCL extensions:\pj{: We should just make them extensions (proposals) to clean up the story.}

%\mb{Pekka: do we also list APIs which can be implemented but aren't yet (because nobody's done the work) ? looking quickly at CHIPBindings.cc, there are >50 hip API functions which have not been implemented, things like Peer2peer, hipIPC*, hipModuleOccupancy*, hipProfiler*, hipMemPool*, hip{Malloc,Free}Async etc; some might require OpenCL extensions }
%\pj{I think not worth listing here, as it's only a matter of time when these are implemented and if apps do not use them, they %are not high prio.}

%\begin{itemize}

%\item {hipGetDeviceProperties()}: for certain device properties, there is no portable way to get the information via the OpenCL device query API.\pj{this should be an easy extension}

% Pekka> I think we can do without this as it's visible only in terms
% of latency/performance to the user, and there should be also other
% similar features which can be observed only in terms of perf., not
% functional correctness (e.g. the typical concurrency to parallelism mapping).
%\item {hipSetDeviceFlags()}: the flags to this call control how the host thread interacts with the driver thread while waiting for the device (yield the host thread to OS, or spin wait).
%
%\item{hipEventCreateWithFlags()}: provides per-event control of the synchronize behaviour (yield thread/spin wait). However, these APIs affect only performance, not correctness, thus can be implemented as no-operations.

% Pekka> Cannot we really implement this without an extension even if we had kernel metadata to traverse? \mb{possibly, if we can always figure out the correct alignments & padding}
%\item {hipModuleLaunchKernel()}: passing args by ``extra'' parameter requires an API for setting all kernel arguments at once.\pj{a new clEnqueueNDRange variation with a HSA-style-specified exact layout argument buffer layout might be useful in any case.}

%\item {hipGraph API}: the API to create, update & launch graphs. The existing cl_khr_command_buffer extension is not sufficient, since we need to work with SVM. (discussed below in the "opencl and spirv extensions" section).

\section{Compilation Aspects}
\label{section:compilation}

This section discusses the compilation flow used by \chipstar. We introduce the overall compilation flow, the device library implementation and summarize our findings on the key needs to extend the OpenCL/SPIR-V standards to bridge key feature gaps between the specifications.

\subsection{The Compilation Flow}

The offline compilation flow of \chipstar is built on the LLVM Project's~\cite{LLVM} Clang~\cite{Clang} frontend which provides the frontend language handling and splitting of the single source input to the device and host parts. The overall compilation process is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:compilation}. It relies on the CUDA/HIP frontend of Clang, which was extended to produce SPIR-V binaries as an option to PTX or AMDIL for the device program. The LLVM \func{opt} tool is used to invoke special LLVM passes provided by \chipstar for lowering HIP features to the OpenCL-SPIR-V environment. The SPIR-V translation is performed using Khronos' LLVM-SPIRV-Translator tool~\cite{llvm-spirv}.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{figs/chipstar-compilation-v2.pdf}
    \caption{The construction of a HIP fat binary. Device code is compiled into LLVM IR, chipStar applies a series of LLVM passes at optimization time. The resulting IR is embedded into the binary and linked against the device library. }
    \label{fig:compilation}
\end{figure*}

Most of the compilation-related changes have been upstreamed to the LLVM project and very little compilation-related functionality remains within the \chipstar code base. The notable exceptions are compiler passes that handle CUDA vs. OpenCL differences in \func{printf()}, implement a device side \func{abort()} feature, handling of CUDA's device-side global variables, and an indirect memory access analyzer. The indirect memory access analyzer marks kernels that are known to not indirectly access allocations, which removes  unnecessary synchronizations for the majority of
benchmarks seen so far. Otherwise, due to CUDA's memory model, each launcher kernel can potentially access any previously allocated buffer, inducing significant unnecessary
data synchronization overheads in the common case where the kernels only access buffers set through their arguments.

%One of the performance-impacting device program passes done in \chipstar is indirect memory
%access analysis: In CG SVM, memory consistency between device and host memories is guaranteed at
%the execution boundaries of kernel commands referring to the SVM allocation. To enforce
%data synchronization, kernels referring to the SVM allocations must either refer to the
%SVM allocations as kernel arguments, or be explicitly marked to indirectly use other
%allocations. The latter poses a challenge, since in principle any kernel can refer to any
%previous allocation as CUDA device pointers can
%be passed inside data structures or global variables.
%For CG SVM,
%OpenCL's \func{clSetKernelExecInfo()} must be used to list all potentially used SVM allocations
%that are not referred to by the argument list.
%This poses a signficant performance overhead risk since the \chipstar runtime must play it safe
%and register all possible previous allocations to any launched kernel, unless proven that the
%kernel doesn't refer to a particular allocation. For applications with a lot of allocations and
%kernels that only use subsets of the buffers, a lot of unnecessary data
%synchronizations between the host and the device memories can happen. To alleviate this
%problem for the seemingly common case of only referring to buffers in the argument list,
%\chipstar implements a kernel analyzer that 

\subsection{Lazy Just-in-Time Compilation}

Fig.~\ref{fig:online-compilation} shows the online compilation flow from SPIR-V to device code in the \chipstar runtime.
%\cb{the figure is just referenced but never discussed in detail -- I'd suggest at least 1-2 sentences to describe more, like the "registerd modules" part} , done -pv
%A SPIR-V module is compiled just-in-time (JIT) when a kernel associated with it is launched.
When a kernel launch is requested, the kernel function stub pointer is used to look up the associated SPIR-V module which, in turn, is just-in-time (JIT) compiled to machine code.
To enhance runtime portability, the built-in library of the on-line device provides variations in built-in HIP functions for different device capabilities that are linked to the user’s device programs at runtime. For example, for HIP floating-point atomics the runtime chooses between an implementation that maps them to corresponding native functions via a SPIR-V extension or emulates them via atomic exchange operations.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{figs/chipstar-rt-compile-n-link.pdf}
    \caption{The just-in-time compilation flow. Once the program is executed, prior to calling main, a series of internal HIP calls are executed. These calls parse the fat binary and register the embedded SPIR-V files as modules. In lazy JIT mode, these modules are not compiled into kernels until their launch is requested.}
    \label{fig:online-compilation}        
\end{figure*}

%The JIT compilation has another benefit that is visible with large applications or libraries. 
Initially, the kernel compilation was implemented in an eager manner in \chipstar: all of the kernels were compiled prior to entering main().  If the SPIR-V has a lot of kernels bundled in, but only a small subset of them are invoked by each application run, the compilation time could grow very high. For example, a neural network framework included all neural network operators in a single SPIR-V library, requiring its compilation at each network launch although only a subset of the operators were actually utilized.
%With eager compilation, execution of a single test would force compilation of thousands of kernels.

To address this issue, \chipstar implements a lazy JIT compilation strategy. With lazy JIT enabled
modules are not compiled immediately upon creation, but rather compilation is deferred until the first kernel call that requires the module. When compilation occurs, the SPIR-V binary is converted to the target format, build flags and options are set up, and backend-specific compilation methods (such as \func{clCreateProgramWithIL} for OpenCL) are used. 
%\cb{The is the first time LZ is mentioned as a runtime. Probably we need to mention it previously or preferably switch to an OpenCL example. otherwise, the part in parenthesis should be removed.} 
Once compiled, modules are cached for future use. This approach significantly reduces startup time for applications with many kernels, as only the necessary kernels are compiled. 

The implementation includes performance monitoring features, tracking compilation time and logging whether modules are loaded from cache or compiled fresh.
The lazy JIT system is designed to be backend-agnostic, allowing different backends (Level0, OpenCL, etc.) to implement their own specific compilation strategies while maintaining consistent lazy compilation behavior. This flexibility enhances \chipstar's portability across various platforms and backends.



\subsection{Device Library}
The \textit{chipstar} device-side library implements the HIP math API, by using a combination of OpenCL C math built-ins, LLVM built-ins, OCML (part of ROCm-Device-Libs), and custom implementations.
Many of the functions in the HIP math API have an equivalent OpenCL built-in with adequate accuracy guarantees. However there are a few exceptions that cannot be mapped directly, and thus require software-based emulation such as floating-point atomics on some devices. The main challenge in terms of a fast yet portable implementation of the functions is due to differences in math accuracy requirements between CUDA/HIP and OpenCL. While CUDA provides very specific ULP accuracy requirements \cite{cuda-ulp} (most of which are higher than those in the OpenCL specification \cite{opencl-ulp}) for their math library, no such requirements were specified for HIP 6.1 which chipStar implements. These ULP requirements are now specified as of HIP 6.3 \cite{hip-ulp} but still seem to diverge from those required by CUDA.  

Furthermore, CUDA/HIP defines a set of \textit{intrinsics}, which are faster yet less accurate versions of the standard functions. 
This exposes a further difficulty when aiming for a portable, yet fast implementation: the level of accuracy achievable depends heavily on the targeted platform. Since CUDA is inherently meant not to be cross-vendor portable, the intrinsics are defined only to match the CUDA microarchitecture in an optimal manner, which might not be the case for other devices. 

OpenCL covers the use case of accessing fast but less accurate hardware operations by means of 1) a relaxed mathematics flag that can be enabled at device program build time and 2) with so-called native built-in functions in the built-in kernel API. Unfortunately, neither of these are usable for implementing the CUDA intrinsics by default due to not guaranteeing enough ULP accuracy as required by CUDA API. The relaxed math in OpenCL defines maximum rounding errors, but they are usually slightly less than what the CUDA intrinsics require Fig. \ref{ulp-math}. The OpenCL native built-in functions are an even worse fit for this use since they guarantee nothing of the accuracy but leave it entirely up to the implementation Fig.\ref{ulp-fast-math}. There is not even a possibility to query for the maximum error via a runtime API, the accuracy must be discovered via trial-and-error or from documentation of the hardware vendor.

Previous research \cite{ulp-comparisons-paper} shows significant disparities in the precision of GPU math functions, with CUDA consistently achieving the highest accuracy, followed by HIP, LLVM, and OpenCL (estimated based on relaxed math). CUDA’s functions maintain ULP errors close to 1, while HIP and LLVM exhibit progressively higher errors, sometimes exceeding 3-5 ULP. OpenCL’s relaxed math and native built-in functions lack strict accuracy guarantees, making it challenging to replicate CUDA’s precision without significant adjustments or corrections.
%\pv{TODO cite: https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3624062.3624166?%27.com#fig9 paper showing ULP for CUDA vs HIP vs LLVM}


The ``correctness first'' principle mandates the use of arithmetics that have  guaranteed accuracy, which means to not receive any performance benefits of simplified implementations. This approach is not taken by DPC++, for example, as it defaults to a more relaxed floating point precision model (-fp-model=fast) %\cb{do we have a citation for correctness first?}\pj{I think it's just a general idea: We should adhere to the specification/reference doc first and not take shortcuts which leads to semantically incorrect results.} %  future work can include runtime checks?
%
Achieving ULP requirements specified in the CUDA API would require emulating them in software . Performance impact would likely be too drastic to make \chipstar usable for high performance workloads.
%\cb{Is "correctness" meant in a specific way here? should it have quotes? I'm worried the term can be interpreted as us just saying it's not correct, so if there's a more precise term I'd rather use that} 
%We chose a middle-ground where the basic math functions are implemented at the OpenCL accuracy level by default and the intrinsics also utilize the default functions instead of the native functions, and thus do not get any performance benefits from intrinsics. \cb{the intrinsics vs default vs native is not clear to me and how it matches with OpenCL C math built-ins, LLVM built-ins, or OCML}  For the workloads we tested, this seemed to be a good enough solution. \cb{As shown in Section ... maybe?} 
% Intrinsics and default are mapped regular OpenCL math funcs. 
% --fast-math makes both of them map to OpenCL native funcs.
% native equivalents not available in every case
Since we cannot make any guarantees about precision, we have chosen to map regular and intrinsic functions to the same OpenCL default accuracy function implementations. 
%\pv{Colleen is this better? } \cb{yes, sounds good}

We plan to optimize this aspect in the future via a new standard extension with a set of built-ins that guarantee the CUDA accuracy requirements to the application programmer while enabling the targeted platform to optimize and implement them as efficiently as possible.

\subsection{OpenCL Extensions}

The \chipstar compilation flow is built such that different advanced OpenCL features and extensions are not required from the target platform's driver or device unless the compiled input application specifically needs them. Although the minimal OpenCL 3.0 feature set plus coarse-grained SVM and SPIR-V consumption support covers a significant part of the most commonly used CUDA and HIP features, some functionalities require or can be improved with extensions to the OpenCL or SPIR-V specifications.

    \label{table:proposedExtensions}
\end{table*}


In Table~\ref{table:extensions} we summarize the standard extensions \chipstar can already utilize and which CUDA/HIP feature triggers their need. Table~\ref{table:proposedExtensions} describes further work-in-progress extension proposals we have identified to be useful for CUDA/HIP portability. These extensions are in different stages in the Khronos Group standardization process, which is noted in the table.\footnote{Note to reviewers: We will update the status for the final article version.}

Most of the extensions are relatively straightforward and the brief description in the table should suffice to grasp their purpose. However, the handling of warp-level primitives calls for a bit more thorough explanation:
One of the execution model differences between CUDA and OpenCL is that CUDA presents a finer grained fixed size grouping of the threads (OpenCL work-items) than the blocks (work-groups) called a \textit{warp}. In earlier CUDA versions, the threads in a warp could be assumed to execute in lock-step, implying that the enabled threads in the same warp would execute the same instruction. This implied that in some cases explicit synchronization could be omitted: In case of a usual read-modify-update case, the programmer could trust that the warp's threads all execute the read part before any of them proceeds to the update part, enabling in-place-updates without explicit synchronization. In later versions of the CUDA specification, the use of lock-step behavior in program logic was deprecated, but the feature has to be supported for legacy applications~\cite{cuda-lockstep}.

In addition to older CUDA programs potentially relying on the lock-step semantics to omit explicit synchronization, the fixed size warps (32 threads for NVIDIA and usually 64 threads in AMD devices) affect the execution semantics when executing warp-level functions that rely on the warp grouping and the mapping of the threads to the lanes of the warp.  Such primitives include the warp shuffles, which read data from a specific lane within the warp, and the explicit warp synchronization primitives.
%
%\pj{There could be a figure here with possible subgroup id mappings and how warps always map the threads in linear order.}
The OpenCL specification, on the other hand, doesn't have a warp concept, but the work-items are free to make progress in any order and grouping. The specification, however, has a feature extension called ``subgroups'' that is used to implement the warp semantics in \chipstar when the kernel is detected to need it. However, in contrast to warps which have a specified form and content which allows the programmer to utilize them reliably, the basic subgroups of OpenCL are ``implementation-oriented''; they enable grouped execution in a manner that is simplest or most efficient for the driver and the hardware at hand. The sizes of the OpenCL subgroups are not fixed, but must be queried per kernel by the programmer in the basic extension. Also the way work-items are mapped to subgroup lanes so they can be referred to when using cross-lane intrinsics is also implementation-defined. To close the gap between subgroups and warps, an enhanced extension that \textit{forces} the subgroup size of the kernel to the desired size along with the linear id mapping is being proposed.
%\kh{As Nvidia hardware generally has a warp size of 32 threads, what are the plans when OpenCL runtimes/devices can't support the size required by the CUDA application?}\pj{No plans so far. We could software-emulate different warp sizes using work-item loops/replication, but I'd rather not go there if not strictly necessary. Does RustiCL support 32-wide subgroups with NV/AMD targets?}\kh{As of today rusticl doesn't support forcing a subgroup size, but drivers are written in a way that it would be possible to do so once the appropriate CL extension is implemented. The AMD mesa driver also has a debug env variable to force 32-wide subgroups. The Intel driver chooses between 8/16/32 as it sees fit. So yeah, just a bit of code missing for it.}

% Maybe also in the title of the paper.

%\subsection{Compiling CUDA Applications Directly}
%\label{section:directCUDA}

%While the primary goal of \chipstar is to cover the CUDA/HIP APIs to the extent defined by the HIP programmer's manual, \chipstar implementation also supports a set of CUDA APIs directly. The ability to call CUDA APIs directly drops the need for source-to-source translations when porting originally CUDA applications to the platform. This is done by simply delegating the CUDA API calls to the HIP versions, similar to what HIP does with their CUDA mapping, but in reverse.\pj{to check}

%There has been legal controversy related to APIs how they are covered by the copyright laws in the past that has made legality of direct implementations of proprietary APIs unclear. This changed with the Supreme Court of the United States ruling of April 5, 2021 in the Google LLC vs. Oracle America, Inc. case, which stated that copying the Java API for use in the Android OS was considered ``fair use'' since it was done for compatibility purposes:

%\begin{quote}
%``Google’s copying of the Java SE API, which included only those
%lines of code that were needed to allow programmers to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, was a fair
%use of that material as a matter of law.''~\cite{JavaSupreme}
%\end{quote}

%Although no code was copied directly from the NVIDIA implementation, even if it was the case we believe
%our limited implementation of the CUDA API falls well within such fair use outlined in the ruling. However, since we, the \chipstar developers are engineers, not lawyers, we wanted to be extra careful that copyrights were not disrespected in any jurisdiction when adding support for direct CUDA API calls by using an implementation approach where only the programmer's manual was consulted for the API reference when implementing the CUDA compatibility headers to the \chipstar code base.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{section:performance}

We evaluated  \chipstar  performance on various OpenCL-capable CPU and GPU platforms using a subset of the HeCbench benchmark collection~\cite{HeCbench}. All of
the results were produced using the \chipstar v1.2.1  release.

The HeCbench benchmark application selection criteria for each comparison was as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The application had the necessary API/language variations with a HIP version that could be built with \chipstar v1.2.1 and its ported libraries.
    \item For SYCL/CUDA comparisons, there must not have been significant identified performance-affecting structural or implementation differences between the SYCL/CUDA and HIP versions of the application. Some of the identified ``unfair differences'' were fixed and submitted to the HeCbench repository.  The exact branch used for benchmarking can be found here: https://github.com/CHIP-SPV/HeCBench/tree/chipStar-bench

    \item The application could verify its results and had to validate correctly on all platforms involved in the comparison.
    \item Applications that required hardware or OpenCL driver features that were missing or too limited on the platform were omitted. This mostly concerned the runs on embedded/integrated GPUs with limited memory or lack of double precision floating point support.
\end{enumerate}

%\cb{the text on the figures varies a lot, we should try to be consistent}
%\pv{Can you clarify?} \cb{the text sizes on the figures varies as well as the style. it's also probably too small -- Fig. 8} \pv{it would probably be very difficult to make all figures look the same now since they're from multiple origins produced at different times. }\cb{ah, ok. if we have the raw data somewhere, we could try to plot maybe. but if too much, it's ok}

\subsection{OneAPI DPC++ on Intel oneAPI SDK}
\label{sec:SYCL-comparison}

For this evaluation we chose a subset of benchmarks included in the HeCbench suite and compared the performance of their HIP versions of the benchmarks against the SYCL versions. 
The SYCL versions were compiled with Intel's DPC++ shipped with the oneAPI v2024.2.2 release. 

%\cb{maybe we need a short overview of which SDKs and hardware will we be comparing again?}
%\cb{which hardware?}
%\cb{maybe we can add a table of what HW etc it's been tested on?}
The following consumer-grade hardware from Intel, Nvida, and AMD was used to perform the  benchmarking: Intel A770 discrete GPU, Intel UHD 770 integrated GPU, Nvidia RTX3060, AMD Vega VII and Intel i9-13900k CPU. 

%\cb{should have some comment about why comparing to SYCL }
Since both \chipstar and DPC++ can use OpenCL as a backend, the evaluations are performed using the same OpenCL driver on the same GPUs. This  isolates the differences between the tested software stacks to the runtime and the LLVM IR level device code compiler optimizations. 

%Thanks to the  OpenCL backend of DPC++, both versions of the applications could be executed 
%using the same OpenCL driver on the same GPUs, isolating the differences between the tested software stacks to the runtime and the LLVM IR level device code compiler optimizations. 

%In Fig. \ref{fig:best-vs-best}, we compare the results using the default compiler flags,  -O3 optimization level and OpenCL JIT optimization flag -cl-fast-relaxed-math. 
 %\ba{One of these figures (probably the first?) should be default-vs-default.} Yes, correct - pv. Fixed
%\pj{The problem is that DPC++ assumes fast-relaxed-math by default which is not a relaxation what CUDA/HIP allows by default, making that comparison uninteresting/unfair.}
%\ba{The text refers to "best-vs-best" in both sentences though.  Is that intended?  If so, I would rephrase, otherwise it seems like there should be two different references.  Maybe I don't understand what Figure 3 and Figure 4 are intending to show.}

In Fig. \ref{fig:best-vs-best}, 
%we compare the results between using the default compiler flags and the -O3 optimization level combined with OpenCL JIT optimization flag -cl-fast-relaxed-math.\pj{Something like: "
we compare the expected fastest results between SYCL/DPC++ and chipStar when floating point relaxations are enabled to the extent the implementations can utilize them. As expected, there are only minor differences in the performance since
 both DPC++ and \chipstar implement their respective runtime by leveraging  OpenCL as the GPU API
%\cb{question about terms: backend vs runtime -- DPC++ has its own runtime, sitting on top of OpenCL, I thought? to clarify the ``runtime" here}
and have a similar compilation flow: kernels are compiled into LLVM IR which is then translated to SPIR-V which, in turn, is then JIT compiled to device code at runtime.  

For the vast majority of benchmarks, the performance difference between DPC++ and \chipstar was negligible, but there are outliers to both directions. DPC++ can currently benefit from FP relaxations more as it defaults to -fp-model=fast \cite{intel-fp-fast} which enables optimizations like floating-point reassociation, fused multiply-add operations, and the omission of certain intermediate rounding steps, as well as the use of less accurate device-side math functions. The HIP/CUDA equivalent is --use\_fast\_math \cite{cuda-fast-math} but \chipstar v.1.2.1 does not yet support this compiler flag.

We investigated the outliers and identified several reasons for the performance achieved:

\begin{itemize} {
    \item \textbf{Device library differences.} }There are significant differences in the device libraries: DPC++ uses the Intel Math Functions (IMF) Device Library \cite{imf-website} whereas chipStar relies on a combination of LLVM built-ins, native OpenCL operations, a few custom implementations, and finally ROCm's OCML bitcode  implementations to provide complete coverage. Furthermore, DPC++ defaulting to -fp-model=fast enables the use of \_native intrinsics which are significantly faster (and more accurate) than non-native implementations.
    %\pj{Why wouldn't we use IMF if it's better?} \pv{We probably will in the future. This was found during benchmarks and outlier analysis}
    \item     \textbf{\textbf{Effect of JIT Flags. }} chipStar sees significantly higher performance increases when JIT flag  -cl-fast-relaxed-math is passed to the OpenCL runtime. 
    \item \textbf{Floating point relaxations}. SYCL on DPC++ defaults to -fp-model=fast which results in %SYCL IR producing <reassoc nsz arcp contract afn > 
%which allow 
more aggressive optimizations by removing IEEE 754 guarantees and assuming no NaN/Inf values, generation of FMAs. In comparison, HIP allows only FMA contractions by default.

     \item \textbf{Value assumptions.} IR produced by DPC++ takes advantage of AssumeTrueKHR which is a SPIR-V instruction that tells the compiler to assume a given condition is always true, allowing it to optimize code more aggressively under that assumption. Using this instruction should give it a performance advantage of chipStar. 
    \item \textbf{Intel-specific decorators.} DPC++ tends to produce IR which often contains Intel-specific operations that are meant to help with optimization when targeting Intel platforms which support the extensions, such as OpAliasDomainDeclINTEL, OpAliasScopeDeclINTEL wheras chipStar IR is more generic.
    %\pj{One could argue that the extensions are not very Intel specific and could be useful to support. Aliasing info?} \pv{I mean these literally end in INTEL so I don't see how we can argue that they are not Intel specific. Also, what do you mean by supporting them?}\pj{I mean the semantics: If these define the alias scope etc. it's not related to Intel HW, but is generally useful. So if we drop these, we drop essential info the JIT could use. But yep, since we don't use them then that's something for the future.}

    \item 

\end{itemize}

%\pj{The following paragraph should be clarified to indicate why the 6 benchmarks are not in the error bounds? Or is it due to the relaxed math differences only?} \pv{Yes, turning on fast math made these no longer pass corecctness checks and the paragraph ends in " A lot of these benchmarks have quite tight epsilon
%bounds so it’s likely that with small adjustments the number could be reduced."}
One thing to note is that the following results include only the benchmarks which passed correctness checks and in this regard chipStar ended up successfully running 6 benchmarks fewer compared to SYCL. A lot of these benchmarks have quite tight epsilon bounds so it's likely that with small adjustments the number could be reduced.

%One interesting observations is that 
%are linked to IMF for SYCL and to LLVM built-in for chipStar. 
In order to analyze the benefits of IMF, we modified the chipStar device library to link against IMF for exp and sqrt calls and tested the performance again which resulted bilateral benchmark going from 0.60x to 0.81x and adam benchmark going from 0.16x to 0.50x. The keough benchmark did not call any math functions.
%\pj{Were there perf. regressions? If not, why not use it by default?} \pv{Only tested a couple of functions, no performance regressions. Not using it because I found out about it after release of 1.2.1}

After we applied the -cl-fast-relaxed math JIT flag, all of these benchmarks performed equally well in \chipstar and DPC++. In conclusion, all the cases where chipStar is slower than DPC++ can be explained by the differences in math device library and the more aggressive default optimization of the IR in terms of floating point calculations due to DPC++ defaulting to -fp-model=fast.

There are 9 benchmarks (\textasciitilde{}15\%)  where chipStar-v1.2.1 outperforms DPC++ by more than 20\%. Of these, most significant difference is seen in gaussian. Upon examination, the time spent inside kernels is identical between these two runtimes so the most likely reason for the difference would be the DPC++ overhead. This overhead cost could be comprised of either DPC++ startup costs, DPC++ kernel invocation costs or a combination of both.

%\pj{Mention "weak scaling"?} '\pv{better?}
To test for this, we isolated the outperforming benchmarks and performed a weak scaling experiment by comparing performance on the original problem size (Fig.~\ref{fig:chipstar-outperform-sycl-1x}) to the performance achieved with the number of iterations increased by 5x for benchmarks that had it as an argument (Fig.~\ref{fig:chipstar-outperform-sycl-5x}). Scaling the iterations and not the cost of a single kernel operation isolates the DPC++ startup overheads.

%\pj{Same here as in the couple of tables I referred. It misses references to the labels from text.}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{outperform-1x.png}
    \caption{Benchmarks where chipStar is outperforming DPC++. Original problem size.}
    \label{fig:chipstar-outperform-sycl-1x}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{outperform-5x.png}
    \caption{Benchmarks where chipStar is outperforming DPC++. 5x the original problem size.}
    \label{fig:chipstar-outperform-sycl-5x}
\end{figure}

Scaling the number of iterations reduced the geomean chipStar-v1.2.1 speedup from 1.31x to 1.17x indicating that DPC++
%\pj{We should not talk about SYCL, the language/API, but DPC++, an implementation of it here.} 
has significantly higher startup costs compared to chipStar.

We analyzed the cases with the most dramatic differences and identified various explanations:
Many of the benchmarks executed very short kernel commands, making the benchmark actually mostly measure the host API call execution speed.
For example, the ``overlay'' benchmark could be sped up significantly by switching off the profiling command queue feature. 
% that was accidentally left on by default. \hl{not accidental. Profiling is used for hipEventElapsedTime.}
In some cases the device built-ins were more optimized in \chipstar than in DPC++, in some cases it was the opposite.
For example, when we compared the \chipstar and DPC++ LLVM IRs of the device code for the ``nlll'' benchmark, we found that only \chipstar performed the if-conversion optimization that converts some of the very small branches to conditional moves, which provided significant benefits.

%\cb{maybe finish with just a sentence summarizing the takeaway -- overall how do they compare?}
In conclusion, \chipstar has lower startup costs than DPC++ and either slightly outperforms or matches DPC++ performance across a variety of benchmarks through there are some exceptions in either direction.

\subsection{CUDA on NVIDIA CUDA SDK}

It is interesting to compare the performance of CUDA programs compiled and ran using the NVIDIA's proprietary CUDA versus \chipstar over an OpenCL runtime. In this experiment, we first compiled applications using the CUDA SDK 12.4 to get a baseline. The same benchmark cases (the CUDA versions) were then compiled using \chipstar to the portable fat binary that uses OpenCL as the portability layer which was then run on rusticl/zink, an OpenCL implementation on top of NVidia's proprietary Vulkan driver. The execution time when compiling using strict maths was measured on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU with the results shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rtx3060-cudasdk-vs-rusticl}. The geometrical of 1.01 tells that the overhead of the chipStar, the OpenCL API and the rusticl OpenCL runtimes is negligible on average. A few outlier cases vary to one direction or another. %\pj{Karol: Can you guess what are the reason for the differences in the extremes?}

%\cb{it may be interesting to discuss the relative "worst performing" and "best performing" compare to CUDA. and maybe a sentence of the overall takeaway -- overall, how does each compare to CUDA? it seems a little unbalanced comapared to all the content for intel}
%\pj{Henry: Can you add a couple of sentences (best educated guesses) here from the top of your head? No need to reproduce the numbers again.}

%\pj{TODO (Karol): Let's rerun with the latest rusticl to see if ``vanGenuchten'' is now faster.}

%Henry>The ``vanGenuchten'' explanation: Not sure what happens truly. The SPIR-V binary that gets passed to the Vulkan driver has pow() function inlined and the kernel outputs a result with more error in it (but still satisfies verification). Perhaps, rusticl/zink uses their own pow() implementation that is a bit relaxed in precision and faster? -Henry

      \label{fig:rtx3060-cudasdk-vs-rusticl}
\end{figure}

\subsection{HIP on AMD ROCm}

Since \chipstar can be viewed as a more portable implementation of HIP, it is interesting to compare its speed against the original HIP implementation from AMD. For this comparison, we utilized the HIP compiler and runtime from the AMD ROCm package version 6.2.4 as a baseline to compile and execute a set of HeCbench HIP benchmarks on an AMD Radeon Pro VII GPU. To run the \chipstar fat binaries on the same GPU, we used the rusticl OpenCL implementation on the radeonsi driver. AMD's OpenCL implementation does not support SPIR-V input at the time of this writing, preventing its use in this comparison for running the \chipstar binaries.

We have already demonstrated that the \chipstar runtime does not introduce additional overheads in Fig. \ref{fig:best-vs-best} so the following performance differences are a product of rusticl, not \chipstar. Rusticl is still in the development phase and is not yet optimized for all targets, which explains the much larger performance differences in Fig. \ref{fig:radeonprovii_rocm_vs_rusticl} compared to Fig. \ref{fig:best-vs-best}

Given the current state of rusticl, there is not much value in doing an extensive performance anomaly studies. However, one such anomaly is `pnpoly' which is more than 2.5x faster on chipStar as can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:radeonprovii_rocm_vs_rusticl}. The reason is that ROCm is slightly faster for tile sizes smaller than 32 and for larger ones notably slower. Unfortunately for ROCm, the benchmark tracks times for the largest tile which happens to be the slowest one on ROCm.

%\pv{Henry ran these numbers and did analysis for pnpoly - can we get something for murmurhash3?}
%\pj{Henry: Can you add a couple of sentences (best educated guesses) here from the top of your head? No need to reproduce the numbers again.}
%We decided to postpone the unification of the illustrations to the Camera Ready phase so we
%get this to external review sooner. --PJ

\subsection{Portability Testing}

In order to test the extent of portability of the runtime API layer based on the OpenCL standard, and to verify that offloading to a GPU via \chipstar can bring speedups in comparison to running on the host CPU, we compiled and executed sets of HeCbench applications on various platforms which included both a CPU and a GPU with a capable enough OpenCL support to execute the same compiled \chipstar fat binary on both devices. Given the experimental state of some of these platforms,  the following performance numbers are not indicative of the true hardware potential and thus should be interpreted solely as indicators of application portability and not performance. The platforms and their results are presented below.
%The HeCbench applications were chosen using the same selection criteria as described in Section~\ref{sec:SYCL-comparison}). 
%\ba{Frankly, I don't think the CPU vs. GPU speedup comparisons are very interesting, and these have been done before.  I think this section would be much more engaging if it emphasized the portability aspects instead of the performance aspects.} 
%\pv{Section is named portability testing - are we okay with how it's presented now?}
%I also reformulated the paragraph a bit. --PJ
%\ba{This is better, but I'd still consider emphasizing more portability aspects.  Rather than geomean performance, what percentage of test cases worked in each scenario? Maybe expand on the limitations of the PowerVR GPU or the lack of fp64 support that hampered portability?}
% Added a sentence to the next paragraph's end. --PJ

\paragraph{RISC-V CPU \& PowerVR GPU:} In this experiment we utilized the VisionFive2 single board computer for building and running the benchmarks. PoCL~\cite{PoCL} was used for running the benchmarks on the CPU and the proprietary OpenCL driver from Imagination Technologies was used for the GPU.  The results are visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:intel-visionfive2-gpu-cpu}. The lower performance (0.74 geom mean) of the PowerVR GPU vs RISC-V CPU can be explained by the GPU having much less on-chip resources than most benchmarks could utilize. 
%The CPU (JH7110) has a 32KB L1 i/dcache and a 2MB L2 cache, 4 scalar cores running at 1.5 GHz (no vector support), while the GPU has only 1 compute unit (CU) running at 600 MHz and 4KB of local memory per CU. 
The GPU also has a native workgroup size of only 32 (subgroup size 16), while most HeCBench benchmarks use a workgroup size ranging from 128 to 1024, leading to additional thread context switches. Due to not being able to force the subgroup size to match the warp width in this platform also prevented some of the benchmarks from running. Furthermore, the GPU's limited local memory is used also to store images, samplers, the OpenCL constant data and pointers to global memory - in addition to the shared data of the application kernels~\cite{PowerVRPerfGuide}. The memory limitations and the lack of fp64 support were the main reason some of the test cases were not running at all on this platform.

      %{there are some benchmark outliers that are >10x slower on GPU vs CPU.
%        asmooth: allocates a local memory array of 1024 floats. This is equal to the on-chip local memory size (4KB) while the local memory is used also in other ways (see prev paragraph), so
%        this most likely results in spilling into global memory.

\end{figure}
\paragraph{Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900K} This platform has a 24-core 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900K and an Intel UHD Graphics 770 integrated GPU. OpenCL on the CPU and the GPU were supported by Intel's OpenCL drivers  24.35.30872.22. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:intel-i9-cpu-vs-igpu}.  It's important to note that the i9 CPU, having 24 cores, is quite powerful compared to the iGPU so we don't necessarily expect a significant offloading speedup in this case, especially when the OpenCL CPU driver is able to vectorize OpenCL work-items across the SIMD lanes of the CPU. However, as expected, most of the test cases run on this platform and are significantly faster on the iGPU, validating the portability as well as the offloading benefits.

%\cb{these sorts of comparisons are hard without any context like BW or peak performance. what's the takeway we want people to have?} \pv{As reference to a well known platform? Since we're comparing CPU vs GPU on ARM and RISC-V? } \cb{I mean -- what's the meaning that chipStar performing for example 2x better on ARM CPU vs. GPU? that could be from any number of things, from better/worse implementations of chipStar on CPU or GPU or just since the GPU or CPU hardware is better. it's hard to know what we're supposed to learn from this comparison } \pv{The takeaway, as I see it, is this: you can use the GPU on these systems, as weak as it may be, and still get a performance boost compared to running on the CPU. Furthermore, you can can see the number of benchmarks N to get an idea on how many benchmarks worked overall which can be seen as a proxy for evaluating the likelihood of success for your workload. }\pj{Perhaps write out this takeaway in the text? These originally were more or less about we just show that it works and can accelerate in comparison to CPU in these platforms.} \cb{sounds good to me. feel free to remove this comment once the text is updated, thanks!}

The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mali-vs-cortex}. A lot of applications were not able to run because of limited memory in the GPU and lack of double precision floating point support. However, various benchmarks showed significant benefits from CPU to GPU offloading, as expected.

%\section{Supporting Newer CUDA Features}
%\label{section:directCUDA}

%HIP is a subset of CUDA features, roughly at version 8~\pj{check this}. Thus, it doesn't include support some of the newer features which can utilize some of the more advanced capabilities of the NVIDIA GPU platforms. Some of these features are difficult to implement efficiently on other vendors' GPU features, and since GPU offloading is primarily done with performance improvements in mind, a functional, but inefficient implementation is less interesting.

%However, for the purpose of completeness, it is interesting to highlight some of the more useful newer features in later CUDA versions, and consider implementation strategies for future work.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusions}

In this article, we presented \chipstar, a compilation flow and a runtime for CUDA/HIP applications using open cross-vendor supported standards. In comparison to previous tools, \chipstar's goal is on source-level compatiblity which we believe has longer-term robustness benefits in comparison to binary translation. %Whereas relying on standardized APIs has its drawbacks in shorter term due to the cross-vendor ``democratic concensus'' requirement, in terms of building open and fair heterogeneous computing ecosystem of the future, 
It relies on open standards at the portability layer level which in our opinion has significant inherent far-reaching value.
%I removed the negative sentences, they were sort of unnecessary here. --PJ

The performance of HIP benchmarks using \chipstar was shown to be on par or surpass their SYCL/DPC++ versions. We've also shown that \chipstar is very competitive against CUDA running on Nvidia GPU with comparisons to HIP and AMD hardware being less favorable due to OpenCL driver options on AMD hardware.
%\cb{what about the other non-SYCL results?} 

An example of the source-level compatibility was provided with GAMESS-GPU-HF, a code base with a significant number of kernel code lines. This demonstrates that \chipstar is a useful option for applications that are not feasible to port to more cross-vendor supported open standard input APIs such as SYCL or OpenMP.

In the future, as \chipstar focuses on expanding the HIP/CUDA feature coverage. The main aspect that requires more work is to expand the directly supported set of core libraries in the CUDA and HIP ecosystems to cover more real-world applications. On the HIP/CUDA core front, we aim to focus on the more advanced recent features such as collaborative groups.
%as well as finalizing the standard extensions to bridge the remaining gaps between CUDA/HIP and OpenCL/SPIR-V.
