\section{Debugging and Profiling Support}
\label{section:debuggingAndProfiling}

Thanks to using the open standard OpenCL as the portability layer, various debugging and profiling tooling options are available to use with little to no additional effort. The following discusses a set of tools that were successfully adopted and used through $chipstar$.

\subsection{Profiling Tools}

% VTune is rather Intel device-specific, uses its monitoring
% interfaces. We cannot provide
% much on top of OpenCL directly for
% wider device support since it doesn't
% have a monitoring API. The only
% data is the profiling time stamps
% from profiling queues.
